L: ***

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,150
S: in to the unknown~

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,810
you know one of the side effects I believe of um... of traveling through time is that

149
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,470
sometimes you'll operate on a different frame rate uh to the rest of... to the rest of people

150
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,060
I even think it's the frame rate because like my hair and stuff is moving it's just me

151
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,280
there's a bit of lag you know

152
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,770
you're you're sort of your server is in the past and you're sort of um

153
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,320
your servers the expat is in is in present day so

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,540
uh-huh

155
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,430
oh my bit rate has gone to zero um that's a show oh

156
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,950
yeah oh the stream first

157
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,400
oh my god no I was worried about this

158
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,340
wait no wait i think it's going back up okay we're fine we're

159
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,440
***

160
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,820
i think so

161
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,050
youtube what is flick calling it's like flickering on and off

162
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,820
what's happening I don't understand I think

163
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,040
why now are we are we

164
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,640
let's just give it just be patient should be patient

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,130
the bitrate is hovering

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,760
you know I keep having this

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,750
I have this experience on stream quite often where

168
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,360
like I don't know why it just happens to me quite

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,410
uh like at least once or twice a stream that my bit rate will just plummet for a few minutes

170
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,620
and then it will come back yeah

171
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,000
um but every time it happens I'll see someone put the buffering emoji in chat

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,870
and what it means is is that at any time someone could put the buffering emoji in and instantly

173
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,640
I will see it I'll be like and then I will just I'll just take a look at it

174
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,360
and then immediately I'll check my bitrate and be like shit shit no not now not now

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,520

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,640
I'm old and I'm proud I'm a boomer and I'm proud

203
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,280
what's the actual like age range for a boomer

204
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,180

205
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,310
oh no that's that's like old and then some

206

how old is a boomer

208
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,460
they're between 58 and 67.

209
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,620
anyone born between 1955 and 1964.

210
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,570
oh oh

211
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,800
then Vox is not a boomer

212
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,080
so it's anyone from from the age 58 to 76 is a boomer

213
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,040
box isn't that a boomerang

214
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,700

I'm I'm I'm not a boomer I'm a puritan

224
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:01,480

where are your fingers

263
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,700

264
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,640
when mysterious was but was was was but a wee babe

265
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,480

268
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,600

really

270
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,260
akin to a dog

271
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,970

you know the one of the person who has the little microphone

283
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,920
and they go up to the dog and they're like can I get a few words

284
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,970
and the dog just goes

285
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,150
i love those videos

286
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,860

287
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,030

who goes like eggs

290
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,100
it kind of sounds like me and mahjong

291
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,990
if you start getting sweaty

292
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,480
like really into it I think it is up there

293
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,570

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,580
no how do you if you if you ever go crazy with poker

295
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,960

okay

299
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,860
maybe that was a bad comparison

300
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,340
oh what else do you play blackjack for what it's worth

301
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,660

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,810
i guess it's like oh I have a I love that

303
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,560
the moment we mentioned

304
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,420
oh my gosh the poker legend

305
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,820
I learned a lot about the casino

306
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:19,420
we need you to do a stream of the mario 64 ds minigames with luigi in the

307
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,880
baby

308
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,140
pretty casino that according to new laws

309
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,520
like that section of the game has to be rated 18 which is so funny

310
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,770
the gambling

311
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,690
yeah yeah because of gambling like luigi dealing

312
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,140
oh like

313
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,920
because of that and of course I was like I was front and center for that you know

314
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,840
that's so crazy

315
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,570
i remember

316
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,860

318
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,740

oh yeah Ike I'm I'm trying to turn you up

320
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,300
but I think it might be your compressor

321
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,580
like every time I turn you up you stay the same volume on discord

322
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,190

323
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,260
no no I fixed it I fixed it never mind

324
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,660

325
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,620

326
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,160
now I'm I i tricked it I turned you down just in time

327
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,750

every single member every member of Luxiem smells excellent

331
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,070
okay that brings up an interesting question

332
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,500
like if each of us had like an official like cologne what kind of scent would it be

333
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,010
oh I've actually oh you know

334
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,990
yeah there was there was somebody who actually actually put one oh my god

335
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,990
you're right oh my god I'm an idiot

336
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,860
let's see can I dig that tweet up

337
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,660
you're going to do it

338
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,160
you're like you want to know why I like chat

339
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,280
I smell like um lynx tobacco and amber

340
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,560
it's what I i spray on myself why

341
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,370
why is that kind like like I feel like i should be disgusted but that sounds kind of sexy actually

342
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,400
it's really nice it's like a smoky type of smell um

343
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,990
smokey

344
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,460
that's not just your kitchen

345
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,560
the instant you mentioned body spray mister I just had like the mental image of

346
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,840
I don't know why because there are all the comparisons to you being a dog

347
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,910
i just saw just you biting down on a butt kind of deodorant fucking blowing up

348
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,780
someone needs to draw that

349
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,520
i remember when I was younger and I had a really dumb moment

350
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,020
where I found like a really rusty like spray can lying around

351
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,800
so I threw a rock at it with a friend until it like ruptured so it started spraying out

352
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,440
and then I was dumb enough to like I wonder what happened if I point this towards my hair

353
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,540
oh

354
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,210
i mean um i had blue hair for a while

355
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,780
oh sure

356
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
i mean more blue than it already is

357
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,830
i see the residues still there like it's still there

358
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,980
no that's natural I was talking like about like in the middle of everything

359
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,460
like like imagine like at the very top of my head like it's just a big blue dot

360
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,190
or are you sure it's blue i think it just like creeped down as your hair grew I think it's still there

361
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,280
maybe it got absorbed into my dna and just kind of went out to the tips

362
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,760
yeah your future generation your child will have like blue hair

363
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,970
yeah all thanks to a ruptured spray can

364
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,840
everyone keeps talking about lag in chat my bitrate is fine it's either youtube or you please

365
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,290
don't make don't make me worry again

366
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,020
yeah I'm watching the stream live so if anything happens then

367
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,240
then mister's gonna tune in and he's like yo you're fucked

368
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,690
no there's been like stutters but it lasts like point five seconds and then it comes yeah no way

369
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,450
you guys you guys you just you're just gonna have to cope I'm afraid

370
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,620
mold

371
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,970
that dream is

372
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,300
reminded me when I was a kid

373
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,820
um some kid for a rock at my head and i left a dent

374
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,800
oh my god

375
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,280
there's a dent

376
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,490
well not anymore oh

377
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,510
actually

378
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,960
i didn't want to tell on them because they were they went up to me

379
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,070
and they were like oh all right don't tell your mum

380
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,140
I was like are we just talking about head injuries

381
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,040
uh-huh

382
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,810
okay head injuries

383
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,700
why are you laughing

384
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,560
I was just because of luke luke has like been relatively tuned out for a bit

385
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
and she's like you guys talking about head injury

386
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,140
okay that is kind of funny

387
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,180
I'd like to imagine that was how that was how Luca made connections like in the mafia

388
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,680
he would just go up to like the the leader of an opposing family

389
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,530
just sit down at the table at about an exclusive club and be like

390
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,680
hey you guys talking about head injuries

391
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,520
i mean that is one way my son died of a concussion the other week

392
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,270
why are you talking to me like this young man what's wrong with you

393
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,150
i was saying like I i uh

394
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,670
i also hurt my head when I was

395
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,920
oh

396
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,330
when I was younger

397
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,900
oh no

398
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,200
i don't all right did you want to hear

399
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
it yeah yeah yeah

400
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,490
it's all dumb

401
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,620
so I i was i was dipping my head on a bucket

402
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,120
a bucket full of water

403
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,030
and i didn't realize that there was a tap on top of it

404
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,940
i was

405
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,880
it was not good

406
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,380
would you guys believe me if I said that i also had a really bad head injury

407
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,840
oh really

408
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,720
i think I've told this story on stream once but um

409
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
i was really into doing parkour when i was younger

410
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,560
and there was this one time when I was gonna like like jump over a wall of sorts

411
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,060
and my feet like got stuck on the edge and kind of hooked in

412
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:58,600
and because they got hooked in it essentially swung me like face first

413
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,200
and then when I slammed into the wall my feet disconnected

414
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,860
and I fell head first into the curve

415
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,210
i had a pretty bad um experience with that as well

416
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,600
um I remember I remember you two

417
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,560
yeah a couple decades ago um some friends and I we were um

418
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,010
I think it was quite late and we all we all went out and we

419
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,760
you know how you know how when you're drunk and then and it's like quite late and you find like a park you know

420
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,510
and suddenly you get the urge to be like oh let's go let's go let's go fuck around on like the play equipment and stuff

421
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,470
you know zip zip like zip lines

422
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,940
like the ones where it's like you know it has the long thing that hangs off with the seat on the bottom

423
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,840
i hopped on and I was like somebody somebody revved me up some somebody gave me some speed you know

424
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,380
somebody fucking power me on and they were like how fast you want to go

425
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,130
and I was like really fast they're like really sure and I was like yeah yeah fucking fucking you know

426
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,690
and they and I underestimate i underestimated how strong my friend was

427
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,170
he fucking arnold schwarzenegger just powered me along

428
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,690
and was like I'll see you on the other side

429
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,890
and i hit hit the opposite end of the zip wire

430
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,200
and I swear to god it hung down I went up by a hundred and eighty degrees

431
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,730
and was about 30 feet like 30 meters in the sky

432
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,970
and in that moment I was like that's it I'm dead

433
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,260
and then it just it went up to the top fell straight down and right as it was about to swing away

434
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,150
i hung on right until it was close to the ground and then I let go

435
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,790
and it just my head just kind of like bounced off the ground

436
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,960
it was really fucking nasty

437
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,590
i know I shouldn't be I'm so sorry for laughing

438
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,140
but the way that you're describing it with the sound effects is genuinely hilarious

439
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,120
it was a big event it was a story transpiring you know i almost died

440
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,040
oh my gosh no

441
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,160
the akuma clan would have ended there

442
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,160
that's it that would have been the legacy over with its last its last ruling member just just wiped out by a zip line

443
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,720
you're the only one left without head trauma come on

444
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,660
it's like the k rule trailer where there's just the k rule shaped hole in the ground

445
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,350
i don't have a head injury but

446
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,800
oh what do I have

447
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,370
maybe that's why you're the brightest out of all of us

448
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,030
every single member of luxian butt Shu has like yeah

449
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,240
oh but um oh I do have an injury

450
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,050
oh when I was like i was like how old was I

451
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,430
i was it infant it was like right after

452
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:54,610
you know all the I mean obviously the poop like hitting me and getting into the fire was a pretty big injury

453
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,940
but like after that I was I was also like still learning how to walk

454
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,460
and then i was walking and then

455
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,610
apparently I don't know any of this because like I was too young for it

456
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,320
but like apparently I stabbed my head against like a corner of a table

457
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,540
oh god and

458
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,920
when I look at my forehead there's like a really small scar

459
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,370
so i think it's it's

460
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,810
i assume it's behind your bangs

461
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,020
yeah it's like really high up it's really high up on the

462
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,510
table corner injury is a very ipad kid injury to receive you know what I mean

463
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,180

464
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,920
i was just wait yesterday

465
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,070
I was holding my food and my thigh actually slammed onto the side of the other corner of the table

466
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,160
oh you got something now

467
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,670
it was fine

468
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,560
that's all that matters

469
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,760
do you swear like you stub your toe on

470
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,260

00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,180
shut up besides the table is too sharp

474
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,330
a lot of times you just go like how could this happen to me

475
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,740
hello darkness my old friend

476
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,210

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,910
oh yes this has to happen to me again yes okay okay

479
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,600
and then i just like you go into full sarcasm mode

480
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,900
yeah usually I'm like all right here we go again

481
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,920
the collab is off go home everybody

482
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,550

483
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,480
all right bye guys

484
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,300
i actually have something I actually have some chronic some clotted cream fudge here that I got for christmas

485
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,820
there's a little bit there's only a little bit left

486
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,630
yes clotted cream mister

487
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,300
what is that

488
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,780
they'll actually know what if that likes cream

489
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,430
no

490
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,660
it's cream but something else is done too

491
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,200
thick creamy by heating full cream cow's milk using steam or a water bath

492
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,360
and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly

493
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,700
how do you use steam to heat something

494
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,080
oh my fucking god

495
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,770
isn't steam made from heating something not the other way around

496
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,680
it's made from heating water yes

497
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,590
and then you use the steam which has heat to heat something else

498
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:40,090
how do you know the milk the next time you boil water

499
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,020
the milk

500
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,820
i mean how do you not get the milk with water

501
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:54,820
i mean mister you know that like like something that's hot has the possibility to transfer that heat to something else

502
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,140
like have you never been in a sauna and thrown water on

503
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,190
uh hot rocks I've been in a sauna before yeah

504
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,500
yeah when you throw water on the hot rocks everything gets so much like hotter when you're higher up

505
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,860
and that's because of the steam

506
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,870
oh i was really like just observing myself when I was younger

507
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,320
what did they have a mirror in there or something

508
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,160
more important more important more important very very

509
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,400
okay

510
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,320
I was just looking at my body

511
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,780
yeah

512
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:38,560
you gotta you gotta make sure you don't overheat yourself too yeah

513
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
I hate that

514
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,720
have you all been in a sauna before yeah

515
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,410
man yeah yeah

516
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,290
oh I've yeah

517
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,900
I've never been in a sauna

518
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,640
to be fair I think with those tattoos in that body I feel like the attention luke would get in a sauna would be like

519
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,550
you know impossible to deal with

520
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,200
I know right I'd be touching them

521
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,260

522
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,840

529
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,980
his bodyguards are outside and then at one point he's like hey yo tony come in here

537
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,270

00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:45,820
no no no and like after that like you can hear me it sounds like I'm going quiet but you if you listen closely you can hear me

698
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:52,070
like my brain is desperately trying to get the syllables out and it's just not happening

699
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,280
i just seen a message from shu

700
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,910
saying i urinated in the forest once

701
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,160
yeah public urination

702
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,400
let's go

703
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,960
why is that statement on its own in a vacuum so funny

704
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,650
oh my god that's how one of my points went away

705
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,340
nostalge

706
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,040
this is like one of the first convos we had and I said I'm so sweaty I need a bath

707
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,880
Ike called me I said get clean boy and Luca said bath pog

708
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,740
nothing has changed over

709
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,920
nothing actually nothing is just that

710
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,560
i wonder if there's anything that happened

711
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,350
in a bathtub

712
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,030
oh when I started compiling stuff in evidence.

713
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,650
oh yeah evidence.zip

714
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,920
have you ever actually used that

715
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,000
I used

716
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:11,260
oh like when I started taking screen caps of oh I didn't use this one

717
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,480
which one

718
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,970

719
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:19,330
not that one there's

720
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,080
jesus christ

721
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,910
I think actually I think elira's empire might have tweeted that

722
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,340
like I think somebody tweeted it

723
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,880
wait which which one are you talking about

724
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,490
I'm I'm again I'm just looking at put it in there

725
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,400
yeah yeah yeah

726
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,680

mister oh my god that's a joke his rice purity is not two

728
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,500

729
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,940
it's not me

730
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,940
nobody should be tattooed yeah

731
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,400
if mine was two then I'd be arrested

732
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,860
actually

733
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,980
that is true yeah what the hell

734
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:20,620

735
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,130
no I am not naming my r tag short

736
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,830

wait can you show the screenshot or like

738
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,300
i think I think they need to see this

739
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,200
yeah the screenshot itself is so much funnier

740
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,250
oh my god

741
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,310

why did I make that

753
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,400
I don't know why did you make this

754
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,780
that's a good question

755
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,500
we

756
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,550
I'm trying to remember can we find

757

758
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,910

760
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,920
oh I i know why I made it now

761
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,000
you're like I'm 173 with with no heels

762
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,530
i just I just put that together

763
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,760
it made you really tiny

764
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,460
i don't know about you but this picture doesn't really exude that it's about like you know height

765
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,450
i don't think that's the subject matter of this

766
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,050
oh no I'm I don't know why I'm thinking about

767
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,600
the the way that you're edited into this meme you look slightly wider than normal

768
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,920
I'm just thinking about it

769
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,160
what was that what was that video I made of you the man of sex

770
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,180
where he just emerged from jail

771
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,000
you made what

772
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,340
do you remember that it's this it's this screenshot from tf2 where there's an outline if somebody threw a wind through like a wall or something

773
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,240
and their name just says the man of sex and it plays a song that's like

774
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,800
yeah I do I do vaguely remember that

775
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,430
wrong use of the meme

776
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,920
people who've been keeping up with lux and laura gonna get all of these

777
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,260
it's gonna be great

778
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,320
I'm like oh I was there for that tweet

779
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,540
i rem I remember there will be like leonardo dicaprio pointing on the couch

780
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,140
one second

781
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,690
it's insanity I mean

782
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm trying to find the old tweets that we did um like right before debut you know

783
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,870
and like going back it's like yeah

784
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,510
I've made 750 tweets since then I'm like damn it's only been a month what the fuck

785
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:32,140
it really is

786
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,880
more than me

787
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,710
789 okay but that has to be a lot of retweets

788
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,990
yeah

789
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,100

791
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,350
is it on the mobile

792
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,190
i think I think it is a mobile

793
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,050
mobile

794
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,380
how many tweets have I made

795
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,680
how many tweets of luxia made

796
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,960
how do I check how many tweets I made

797
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,080
yeah you go into uh you going to mobile

798
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,200
i just thought of something

799
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,730
we all talked about how like certain things haven't changed

800
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,270
since like prior to prior to debut

801
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,020
but what about what are some things that have changed for you guys

802
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,240
um

803
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,700
wait repeat the question sir I was uh i was not on my

804
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:37,240
like what's something that a lot of things have like stayed relatively the same ever since we first started like hanging out and since we debuted

805
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,020
but what are some things that like have changed like preferably something positive

806
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,860
uh I think I've talked to more people

807
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,680
hmm

808
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,750
how many collabs I did today and I think i did 16 since debut which is quite a lot damn

809
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,060
that is a lot isn't it yeah

810
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,480
and that's only on my channel

811
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,870
that's pretty sure

812
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,820
i don't even know how many I've done

813
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,680
i remember in my second week like once we were um once it sort of opened up and we were

814
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:14,990
and we could collab with everybody like i would collab with so many people like i was just so excited

815
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,220
oh this is my boy piss

816
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,470
hang on

817
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,190
one thing that changed

818
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,340
i spoke more japanese

819
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,510
that makes two of us nice

820
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,440
yeah

821
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,730
i don't think I've spoken this much japanese and I don't know how long

822
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:55,030
it's it's I'm I'm very very much not used to it

823
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,000
one thing that has um

824
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,020
i guess I'm pogging more definitely

825
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,180
you know Shu pocket

826
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,370
you mean to tell me that you haven't haven't always been pogging as much as you are now

827
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,130
that's just what Luca does

828
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:15,080
yeah I I've been if I was pogging times 10 before debut I'm plugging times 1000 now

829
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,010

831
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:21,920
right hundred times

832
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,600
i can't really like say anything that's if

833
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:34,370
nothing's really like change change for me but it's it's uh you know it's been very

834
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,140
it's been very happy

835
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,010
didn't you say you stopped watching anime

836
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:45,300
yeah I stopped watching it yeah I've had no time for anime anymore

837
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,320
don't know

838
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,860
I've had a little bit of time to watch anime thankfully I'm very thankful for that

839
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,700
but that's just me being a weeb

840
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,930
i probably would have time

841
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:58,830
but I just decided not to

842
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,180
I've had a lot of time for comfort youtubers

843
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,960
I don't I don't want that much anime

844
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,700
I watch oh yeah I watch linus tech tips

845
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:17,380
that's my comfort watch I just like listening to this little canadian man be like this is a computer with 19 cuda cores

846
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,050
and like I don't know what the fuck those are but keep talking your magic to me little man

847
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,420
i watched the the lock picking lawyer

848
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,960
the long picking lawyer what

849
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,700
oh yeah he's good disney

850
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:36,140
there's a guy that just has a whole collection of locks and he just picks locks

851
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:43,880
and like this lock has two serrated pins one one very long pin that's not like the other pins

852
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:55,440
and you you could pick them by using a tension wrench and the the pins that's included in the kit that i sell online over at covert instruments.com

853
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,900
yeah

854
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,410
that's what they say

855
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:05,110
a comfort youtuber that I like is a game review channel

856
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:07,900
that covers basically sort of any sort of games

857
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,500
but like the way he covers them like from stories from the history development history

858
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,120
and also it's very very in-depth very detailed and he's

859
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,180
the way the presentation is hilarious at times and also just really relaxing at times

860
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,280
i find myself falling asleep to it it's a channel called some call me johnny

861
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,460
and I just really really adore it and I feel like more people should appreciate

862
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,040
it it's like really really underrated in my opinion

872
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,960
it just popped i don't know where that came from from the darkest like part of my head

873
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:32,300
I don't know why I said that but something about just someone opening his wall and being like all right time to get my credit card up ms is like yeah

874
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:37,460
and then mister would be like scared of the dark be like no I don't want to be in here anymore

875
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,940

876
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,540

881
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:09,830
i wouldn't want to

882
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,280
i remember seeing like this video covering a dude

883
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,050
I don't know where he was from but he like hasn't had a bath in like 13 years or something ah

884
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,410
what that's kind of pug champ

885
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,580
i mean at that point you're just gonna admire the dedication

886
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,280
imagine the stench

887
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,140
yeah

888
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,650
imagine the smell

889
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,020
of thinking it

890
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,440
who's gonna be the one to say it

891
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,930
imagine the taste

892
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,290
wait wait wait wait

893
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,240
is that what you were talking about no

894
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,540
i was thinking about the you smell thing

895
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,120
why did you go to jail

896
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,920
you didn't even get that

897
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,680
oh

898
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,370
I was just staring at the poop on the table

899
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,360
this probably smells a bit as it sits here

900
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,080
I'm quite pungent indeed

901
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,680
oh no

902
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,270
no don't

903
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:16,850
how does it feel to have your arch nemesis just chilling on the table like that

904
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,640
i mean it's poop

905
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,680
that it is damn he really really did be spitting facts

906
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,660
the poop itself was not at fault in the end it was the guy that controlled the poop

907
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:37,990
um are we ever gonna get lore of you going back in time to just kind of fuck that guy up you know

908
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:41,160
i don't know I kind of like this time era

909
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,210
okay fair enough

910
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:47,350
so very like the villain but he's sort of just helped come back easy

911
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:52,000
you know I've watched my fair share of steins gay I'm scared of the butterfly effect

912
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:14,360
one small act can change drastically you played until dawn how do you not know what the butterfly is yeah that's

913
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,880
what I know what it is
one small act can change drastically you played until dawn how do you not know what the butterfly is yeah that's

914
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,920
what I know what it is

915
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,960
oh Luca asked who asked

916
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,770
oh my god

917
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,400
what the fuck what the hell

918
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:42,840
i mean there are times where some of us i can't really put my finger on who like that that I have a hard time discerning the voice

919
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,020
at least in the beginning i had a hard time

920
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,080
oh

921
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,700
you know that's me when mr impersonates ike

922
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,650
really

923
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:55,100
i i think I'm too too drunk to do this

924
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,900
oh no give it a try give it a try

925
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,020
mister

926
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,150
mister

927
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:07,710
see the only reason why I could tell apart those two is because of the mic quality honestly

928
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:21,700
and then some people apparently when i like like uh yell and stuff I sound like Luca

929
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,670
really

930
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,260
oh yeah because both of you like yelling at boys don't you

931
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,690
first thing pog

932
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,880

00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:40,660
usually usually it's like the oh no no pog pog

938
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,050

939
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,920

940
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,950

984
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,000
me neither did i

985
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,400

987
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:22,240
this or that questions

988
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,040
the first one is television series or movie

989
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:25,950
oh okay

990
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,460
who starts let's go one at a time

991
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:32,200
i I think um television series

992
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,070
yeah I watch anime

993
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,730
I'll go to the movie

994
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,960
i kind of sit down for the people as well

995
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,190
although I do love me my series but I'm I'm a movie person

996
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,650
we got three for tv two for movie

997
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:55,480
yeah I feel like I like series more than anime movies

998
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,550
yeah um

999
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:01,000
I mean if I'm going into a cinema then it's kind of different

1000
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:03,290
but like just in general

1001
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,400
I mean you wouldn't watch a tv series in a cinema

1002
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,730
well yeah imagine experience though

1003
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,780
that's gonna be him I have to be a very cinematically produced tv show

1004
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:19,170
have you guys done uh used 3d like in a movie before because I've never done that

1005
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,670
I'm

1006
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,540
kind of oh yeah I have it's fantastic

1007
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:33,510
i have it's ready

1008
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:45,400
other times they just kind of convert a wait traditionally shot movie into 3d and it always looks bad

1009
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,020
I remember once when I saw a movie that I i I won't name the movie itself

1010
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,990
but I took my glasses off just to see like what the heck

1011
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,090
because I didn't notice any 3d effect

1012
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:58,860
and I i I'm not kidding you

1013
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,700
the best 3d effect in the entire movie was the subtitles

1014
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:10,390
yeah it's the text and everything you know because that literally like pops out all the time

1015
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,370
oh sorry

1016
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:20,600
oh I went to watch it like a 3d movie and then like you know in cinemas they have like all these like advertisements before the actual movie stars

1017
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:26,500
like all the advertisements in the 3d theater were like amazing like they were so immersive

1018
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,630
they were like like throwing things left and right on my face I was like oh oh wow

1019
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:37,120
oh my gosh look at all these ass this mute this 3d movie must be amazing because of how the 3d technology is working and everything

1020
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,980
and then the actual movie like the 3d is like so like flat I'm just like

1021
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,630
okay the guy's nose is a little pointed out

1022
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:52,120
you can see yeah I felt damn I feel like ebenezer scrooge's nose is about to just really brush my own nose damn

1023
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,160
they they have actual 3d glasses now

1024
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,240
though yeah they do the red blue ones yeah

1025
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,980
yeah those have been gone for quite a while

1026
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,800
wait yeah

1027
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,840
the cinemas I've been to for like decades now

1028
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,700
now if 3d was using those glasses which they probably do now

1029
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,580
they have a lot better

1030
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,730
yeah yeah

1031
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:22,680
if you ever used to get like the thing where one of your eyes would just see one of the colors like after you take them off yeah

1032
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,960
yeah yeah the red and blue

1033
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,980
I always like i always used to feel dizzy like when i went to a cinema and saw and saw a movie in 3d and I'd leave

1034
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:35,040
I just feel like like I just feel really dizzy I don't know why

1035
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,500
i guess it's just the disconnect

1036
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:47,040
someone in someone in chat just said 3d movies unpog scratch and sniff movies however

1037
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,700
did you guys ever see what was it did you guys ever see spike kids four

1038
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:53,800
yeah spikes oh my god

1039
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:59,150
no I didn't I didn't but I saw the ads for I saw that there was literally

1040
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,600
okay okay there is literally a moment in the film

1041
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,490
where like a dog just takes a shit and then one of the like

1042
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:09,760
the fact that like the way it works is they give you like that thing and there are numbers on it

1043
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,400
and a number appears on screen it tells you which thing to scratch you can sniff it and smell what's in the film

1044
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:20,060
and there's a moment where a dog just takes a shit and it's like number four and I'm like

1045
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:23,440
it's it's a no from me it's a no from me

1046
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,350
i remember when I was at I think it was universal studios

1047
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:33,050
and I went to see shrek 4d

1048
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,740
wait is that is that shrek forever after

1049
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:43,860
no no no no like it's like a dedicated like short for like a ride

1050
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:49,320
and there there's this one part I think it's donkey where donkey just sneezes at the screen

1051
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:56,640
and there's like water water what is that that happens it's like sneezed in the face

1052
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:04,340
the entire crowd just had like a collective groan of disgust when it happened

1053
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,060
actually

1054
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:11,550
yeah I went to a place in france a while ago called called futuroscope

1055
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,670
and they had like simulators like that

1056
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:18,690
and every time there was like oh it's like yeah no all you guys are going through the water

1057
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:22,120
and then they would just spray a little war in your face just like I'm not having fun

1058
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:29,570
hold on everybody I need it I i need a drink let me go I'm gonna quickly uh leave

i remember it was like terminator 2 also a dedicated short for that attraction

1072
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:26,320
and that was cool they had like a big room with three massive screens with projectors

1073
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,310
and there was like actors actually running around on a stage

1074
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:36,500
and on the projectors there were like cgi um like robots and whatnot

1075
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,720
that actually reached out it was a really really cool show like that

1076
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,800
when everything's created with the 3d in mind it can be really really cool

01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:49,960

because you'd said cocktail

1129
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:25,690
oh god

1130
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:28,770
it's like it's that meme of mr incredible becoming uncanny

1131
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,810
Luca asking like hey what's a cocktail and expecting mister to send a picture of a drink

1132
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:36,760
and then mister sends a picture of black and white

1133
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:42,790
all right

1134
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:46,940
vc that's what uh sex on the beach looks like

1135
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,140
why is it called sex on the beach

1136
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,700
because it looks like a beach

1137
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,980
okay but why why the fornication where's the taste like sex

1138
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,240
it's also got a cherry

1139
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:05,040
yeah so if it's so so you can see you can park you can pop it you can pop the cherry right

1140
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,570
I hate it here

1141
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,610
oh like

1142
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,180
oh I

1143
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,760
is there a saying

1144
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,940
it is yeah

1145
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,380
i see

1146
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:18,100
it's pretty uh

1147
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:23,920
it's it's a more it's a more kind of kind of mr Vox type con context

1148
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:32,540
uh but if if it was like you and i were playing chess for the first time like I introduced you to chess I'd be popping your chest cherry you know

1149
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,390
uh

1150
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,140
okay

1151
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,070
it's like

1152
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:41,730
there's so many ways to phrase that differently box why did you have to go with that

1153
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,250
i think

1154
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:03,170
honestly I think we should just scroll through and see the ones that like we think are interesting

1155
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,000
yeah let's just test group

1156
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,650
bless you

1157
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,780
that's good to see

1158
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,680
the toilet if it goes over

1159
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,350
yeah

1160
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,420
anything but over we're gonna have a problem

1161
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:31,590
it's like it's like when they when they orient the toilet paper so the toy pepper the toilet paper like beats from the the other side

1162
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:34,060
what I don't know these questions

1163
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:38,100
what do you mean hold on I have a picture that perfectly some sums it up

1164
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,560
okay

1165
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,280
like like when you pull it off

1166
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,980
no no no no I got you

1167
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,190
i I the left is under the right is over

1168
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,770
oh wait

1169
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:49,810
you guys use though

1170
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,310
dude I just put i put mine on the door handle

1171
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,980
why door handles

1172
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,760
i can completely understand just not wanting to use the toilet paper holder

1173
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:11,720
and just kind of leaving it like maybe on the like on the the top of the toilet or maybe like nearby

1174
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:17,080
the door handle just seems like a weirdly sort of like why would you bother

1175
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,980
yeah it's like a little effort

1176
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:27,470
the door is next to the the but then when you try and pull it off you're just going to yank it down and then it the door opens right

1177
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:30,680
no but it's not always there I mean when I'm shitting

1178
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:39,820
wait wait wait so when do you shit you pick up the toilet roll and put it on the thing

1179
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,600
yes because then it's next to me

1180
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,350
why do you bother

1181
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:49,740
why not just put it on the thing and leave it there like another thing

1182
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:57,080
i don't have a thing so I either put it like on the floor on the bathtub or i put it on the door you know

1183
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,060
the door

1184
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,720
hit the door

1185
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:07,380
yeah you know how much unnecessary effort you're putting into this

1186
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,160
while you guys do this in the uh the bathroom right

1187
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:15,910
obviously you're cooking sausage or bacon which one which one which one huh

1188
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:29,830
bacon is better than sausages I think

1189
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,460
high five mister

1190
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,950
is this like breakfast sausages

1191
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,880
it's all about sausage barbecue sausages

1192
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,900
barbecue sausages type of sausage Luca

1193
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,310
huh

1194
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,080
is that

1195
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,980
there's only one type what it's not

1196
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:53,110
that's only one type of sausage

1197
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,940
what

1198
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,440
oh my gosh it's like the only one type of nut thing all over again

1199
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,330
i like uh

1200
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:04,330
it's always good tumbling sausages

1201
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:08,960
they're pretty anyway uh apartment or house

1202
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,240
house

1203
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,510
what the

1204
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,640
that's a good question um

1205
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,820
it's a good question um

1206
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:22,000
for me I like houses but I'm also I'm drawn mo I think I'm drawn to apartments

1207
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,780
because you can have them in a very central area

1208
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,830
you know what I mean

1209
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:32,900
like yeah like maybe in the mid like if you wanted to go really really central like the middle of a city

1210
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,560
you're not going to find a house

1211
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,300
like if you haven't if you haven't enough if i want to live

1212
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,560
i feel like I'm

1213
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,780
i don't know I can't be loud yeah

1214
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,720
exactly I can't scream

1215
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,940
i prefer a house yeah

1216
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,550
there are solutions I mean look at me

1217
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,620
I'm still in an apartment

1218
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:56,180
I'm not gonna buy a sound booth

1219
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:03,180
or or if they build the apartments well enough to the point where the sounds won't become an issue

1220
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,080
that's best case

1221
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,740
yeah that's also true

1222
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:16,400
i feel like I'm more of an apartment person although I do like to be loud so then like there is like us i would have to try and fix that oh

1223
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,600
also if you have a house you need anything that will block me off

1224
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,730
it's when it's when someone like stop like

1225
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:28,130
for example if if you're in a an apartment

1226
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,300
you're being loud

1227
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,120
they just stomp on top of you

1228
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,320
yes yes yes that makes sense

1229
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,080
oh yeah it's gross I mean I want to move

1230
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,230
i hate him

1231
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:40,790
like late night

1232
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,920
that actually happened during our pro pound collab

1233
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,110
really

1234
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:50,420
yeah I got a stomp on me from my annoying neighbor upstairs

1235
01:18:50,420 --> 01:19:02,110
and I was like you you little it is it is a holiday you know damn well that people are off work

1236
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:07,220
I'm allowed to be allowed around like 10 or whatever

1237
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,550
like piss off

1238
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:15,000
yeah I wish I could scream at like 3 a.m

1239
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,980
yeah that's insane

1240
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,200
adoring ever since I got the booth thing

1241
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,820
i can be loud at any hour I want and not have a single worry

1242
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:31,650
yeah since I stream in like under the living room

1243
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:39,790
like for example when food's ready or something like that they call me by stomping

1244
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:43,910
it is the most annoying thing ever

1245
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:51,830
like just call me or something dude just message me why do you need to stomp

1246
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:58,340
come down and knock on my door like a normal human being be like

1247
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:08,360
yeah I don't blame you that would be like um it's like when people want to get my attention and they just whistle at me

1248
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,670
that's like poking me in the eye

1249
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:11,720
like I'm not a dog no offense mister

1250
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,280
yeah it uh

1251
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,190
he just lit him feeling his legs

1252
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:28,410
it's the same feeling as the alarm

1253
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,260
like that

1254
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,980
no like stomping uh

1255
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:44,850
while I'm like streaming or something same feeling as when you get woken up by your alarm

1256
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:47,480
oh I know I know what you mean like

1257
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:51,610
the the the default alarm noise that everybody grows to despise

1258
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:55,900
do you have like my guys when you hear it you get kind of freaked out

1259
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,420
yeah

1260
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,650
when I hear that one it makes my heart beat

1261
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,450
yeah yeah yeah it gives me like cold skin I hate that

1262
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,340
there's this one uh alarms town I used to set

1263
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,880
it's like uh it's like one of those alarms that you sometimes hear in movies

1264
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,460
when there's like an like a alert alert

1265
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:23,380
that was the one I said it as and then like sometimes in like movies they would play like the exact same sound and

1266
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:28,160
and then I would like literally like be like oh I can't watch this anymore this is pain this is pain

1267
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:32,450
yeah it's triggering my my past traumas like

1268
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,590
uh it's so bad

1269
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:41,530
it's only bad for that one because like that's around when like i had to wake up in the morning every morning for like school and stuff

1270
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:43,300
yuck

1271
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,710
i had to change my alarm sound so like I don't get that anymore

1272
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,800
so bad

1273
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,120
i used to have this one alarm clock that i used to joke was like forged in the fires of hell

1274
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,680
because it was pitch black plastic that looked like it'd been melted slightly from heat or something

1275
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:07,920
and the digits on it was like pure red that just glowed in the dark like a set of devilish eyes

1276
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,060
and when you would like set that and then went off

1277
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:19,490
i kid you not it was loud as hell and the like alarm tone was just a shrieking

1278
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:28,290
it did not like it woke up the entire house but one thing that it was good at it was getting you off

1279
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:35,220
because it would not stop unless you walked up and turned it off and I had it at the opposite side of my room

1280
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:39,190
so at that point I might as well go get up

1281
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:42,120
never like at that point

1282
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,280
your your sleep is just going to be made awful by that kind of thing

1283
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,040
like earlier on stream i had it I had one of my alarms went off

1284
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,940
like I have an alarm clock that has two settings for it one of them went off on stream

1285
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,740
that it's an alarm that like grab it's a light that gets brighter over about half an hour
and people are like what the fuck is

1286
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:01,830
that it's an alarm that like grab it's a light that gets brighter over about half an hour

1287
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:07,840
and then when it gets so half an hour before you wake up it starts getting brighter to simulate like the sun

1288
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,480
and then you're like ah and when you finally wake up you're like ah

1289
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,900
and then bird song starts playing you're like ah good morning everybody

1290
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:23,020
anyone who gets woken up by phone vibration is just going to feel like you know

1291
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,580
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1292
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,520
you know do you have right on for your alarms

1293
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,540
i don't think is that a setting

1294
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:31,900
yeah

1295
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,020
i put it on my legs

1296
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:38,510
so it just like vibrates against your legs and that wakes you up

1297
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,940
so mister just comes violently in the morning and that was what wakes up

1298
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,690
and like Vox

1299
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:50,670
from the leg if you put

1300
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:58,040
i know like he didn't say that but he meant it

1301
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:08,210
i oh that you're tall but you have must have very long legs in order to take these kinds of leaps in logic

1302
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:17,250
i don't know I've never

1303
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,920
mr and I are the same breed and I just kind of I just got to tell what he's getting at

1304
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,540
like like when you had like an xbox or a ps4 or something like

1305
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:28,870
I know what you mean right yeah yeah

1306
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:32,340
and you just kind of like you know place it down

1307
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,260
no

1308
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,360
on your leg

1309
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,800
oh

1310
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,620
mister

1311
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,990
on your balls mister

1312
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,010
no no

1313
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:56,480
i like putting the ps4 controller on my balls

1314
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,280
no

1315
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,560
i like the way it makes my balls feel

1316
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,120
oh yeah

1317
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,980
back to the topic of alarms

1318
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:18,210
apparently if you like think hard enough like that you'll sleep this amount of time

1319
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,400
and wake up at this time

1320
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,270
you actually like don't need an alarm

1321
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:25,460
yeah oh the internal clock

1322
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,340
yeah yeah and then yeah

1323
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,640
I've never used an alarm for like the past

1324
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,600
whoa really

1325
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,720
whoa you just wake up

1326
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,340
yeah

1327
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,380
oh

1328
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:42,390
i don't ever use alarms for whenever i have to wake up for a collab

1329
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:43,920
I'm impressed

1330
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,280
yeah a lot of times like i know that I'm capable of doing that

1331
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,930
but also I'm like uh you know I'll just rely on this alarm yeah

1332
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:54,630
do you just kind of like sense it

1333
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,830
yeah like like I work I i told myself i was going to wake up at 3 a.m today

1334
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:04,320
because do I have to basically get ready for the collab

1335
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:08,020
and I yeah i woke up literally 2 59

1336
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:13,040
and my a lot like my backup alarm actually went off

1337
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,600
all right do you guys ever like wake up just before your alarm

1338
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,620
because that happens to me a lot

1339
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,460
yeah yeah yeah

1340
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:24,710
that's what happens when you yeah that's like that's like the human built-in clock yeah

1341
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:29,270
i mean for me I'm I'm kind of more on the unlucky side of the spectrum

1342
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:35,520
because whenever even though I do set alarms for things whenever I'm getting like a nap before like a stream or a collab or something

1343
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,430
I wake up like sometimes two to three hours before it goes off

1344
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:44,620
and then I just keep waking up and going back to sleep in like 20 minute increments

1345
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,550
until the alarm finally happens

1346
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:54,410
it's like my body is just like better better better wake up way in way in advance just in case

1347
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,180
it's terrible

1348
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:03,530
all I have to do is sleep for three hours and I'm I'm very energized I don't know why

1349
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:06,640
but I don't think it's oh at all

1350
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,520
I think three hours is like the the single sleep cycle right

1351
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,220
I think um

1352
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,560
it's like in three hour increments you sleep

1353
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:22,060
and then like your your mind is like pretty refreshed after the three hours

1354
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,300
cycle or something

1355
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,980
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1356
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:34,350
you're like mine your brains yeah when you sleep like your brain sorts out all like your your memories and stuff so if you

1357
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:39,680
and the cycle ends in like three hours or three hours there's two cycles oh 90 minutes per cycle yeah okay

1358
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,010
i never tried basically food

1359
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,740
three hours only though I try to go for at least six

1360
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:49,800
oh yeah yeah six hours is is is a good amount

1361
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:56,540
like I i I feel like my ideal amount of sleep is about five hours but it catches up to me

1362
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:02,500
you know like I'm always really awake if I sleep five hours but then two or three days of that and I'm like

1363
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,210
yeah

1364
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:08,880
i feel like no matter what I sleep oh my god the nerd

1365
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:14,190
i feel like for me no matter how much i sleep

1366
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:19,920
i will get tired during the day to the point where I'm going to want to take a nap regardless of what I'm doing

1367
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,810
it's honestly kind of frustrating

1368
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:25,210
but naps naps are so nice though

1369
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:27,020
they are

1370
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,640
i need my nine hours

1371
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,450
before we debuted i would actually nap every single day

1372
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:33,150
really

1373
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:34,130
but uh

1374
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:35,140
oh

1375
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:40,960
and then a friend of mine said oh that's very bad you should never do that

1376
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,880
nine hours is fine what's wrong with nine hours

1377
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,190
they they're just they're just haters

1378
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,690
the haters

1379
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,720
yeah

1380
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,900
i know this is really good what

1381
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:57,510
i i nap I i napped earlier today

1382
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:02,270
i can't understand how people nap because I feel more tired after I nap

1383
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:03,880
i don't know

1384
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,240
how long you now

1385
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,340
yeah

1386
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:13,580
me too but also I feel like I nap when like I'm already having a real

1387
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,010
like if I'm having a day off a nap is fucking beautiful

1388
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:23,880
do you know what the the right solution is for a day off when you want to just relax as hard as you can

1389
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,660
what's your favorite youtube

1390
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:30,550
so here's how it works it's it's a process right

1391
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:36,060
your side of the your side like your desk you're just doing whatever you want you're like okay

1392
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:44,210
i need to decompress so you go and you get an alcoholic drink of your choice

1393
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:47,980
me right now I have a beer for me it's a beer that's my choice

1394
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:54,100
you drink a beer and you watch a comfort youtuber you just kind of lie back and you're like yeah this is that

1395
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:58,310
and then make sure that your bed is ready

1396
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:04,780
and when it's ready you go and you have a hot shower

1397
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:11,670
a shower that's like fucking just like like oh you're like really fucking hot shower

1398
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:15,360
and then once that's all done

1399
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:22,370
you just come back dry yourself off and collapse into bed and you will have the nicest nap

1400
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:26,400
and then when you wake up when you wake up two or three hours later

1401
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,300
order kfc

1402
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,640
um

1403
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:36,910
what can you order what can you order

1404
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:38,720
some reason these guys

1405
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,160
they have like 10 delivery every single time it's

1406
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:46,320
i never buy from them

1407
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,410
wait let me add something on to that

1408
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:54,500
it's even better if your bed is like freshly made and all the like the bed sheets are like nice and cool

1409
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:57,070
yeah you're right

1410
01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:02,780
wait do you ever just like take a shower and lie down on the floor

1411
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:04,630
on the floor what

1412
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,930
i don't like lying down on my sleeve because it's hard

1413
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:12,280
yeah you just like turn it up all the way like no cold water at all and you just like lie down

1414
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,420
what yeah wait

1415
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:19,110
kind of get what you mean I mean my showers are not even like it's like a little circle

1416
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:22,700
so I can't really do that but I'll sit on the floor sometimes and just kind of meditate

1417
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,010
oh

1418
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,700
oh just like sit down at the bathtub like under the running water

1419
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,200
yeah raymond raymond understands

1420
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,220
yeah

1421
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:34,780
yeah I pass out there a lot well

1422
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,940
it's nice it's therapeutic you know

1423
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,330
it's a waste of water but it's therapeutic

1424
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:42,810
yeah yeah you know when you're going to shower

1425
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:48,640
did your showers ever used to like be hot and then it would just go cold randomly and then back to hot again

1426
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:54,740
showers that have done that but like that's always been like when I'm staying at some other place

1427
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,830
oh yeah that's usually when someone turns the scene right

1428
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:59,860
that was it or yeah

1429
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,410
turns the sync on flushes

1430
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:04,520
little girl

1431
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,440
yeah yeah

1432
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:11,530
that's how their plumbing works right because it's all connected

1433
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:20,200
that was one of the questions showers or baths

1434
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,110
that's a good question like

1435
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:32,120
it's a difficult one because where I'm living right now i don't have a bath I've only got a shower

1436
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:39,880
I'd really like to go somewhere with a bath because I can't imagine like because baths are just so relaxing

1437
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:45,330
i like showers I really like showers

1438
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:56,630
the thing about baths for me is like like like uh filling up like the tub must be like convenient

1439
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:02,090
the places I've been usually it was kind of a hassle like you had to go the extra mile in order to prepare anything

1440
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:09,980
so like uh usually if you have like the bathtub in the shower like combined so it's like super easy and super convenient

1441
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:14,250
then I would be having baths all the time but unfortunately I've never been that

1442
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:17,880
fortunate to have anything like that at any place I've stayed

1443
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:22,680
what if what if you're taking a bath and and you

1444
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,180
such a heavy sleeper you tried you tried

1445
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,620
to drown

1446
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,430
i tried like sleeping

1447
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:45,100
oh this did not work

1448
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,000
um

1449
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,200
when your head like goes down into the water you wake up immediately

1450
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,660
yeah yeah

1451
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:56,770
that's it's one of the reasons why they say it's impossible to like you know choke yourself to death

1452
01:33:56,770 --> 01:34:03,120
because like the instant you the water like before you die you'll pass out

1453
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,130
and then your hands will fall off your neck and you'll wake up you know

1454
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:10,650
Luca I think it's more of like if if you're asleep in bed right

1455
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:15,850
and if somebody somebody just splashes water at your face wouldn't you wake up

1456
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,260
yeah yeah but this is a bath though once you fall in

1457
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:25,000
well well yeah yeah so i think it's like it's crazy

1458
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,080
a bathtub is not 10 feet deep dude it's like fucking up to you

1459
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,320
what type of bathtub are you talking about

1460
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,020
you're not going to fucking drown in it dude it's not that deep

1461
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:42,790
yeah like if it but if it ever happens think about it

1462
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:48,400
your head's slowly falling into the water your mouth is in and and you start to uh

1463
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:53,680
you wake up and you're like oh yeah you inhale it the water

1464
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:55,150
yeah

1465
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:58,000
i think I think I wouldn't panic though

1466
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,120
I'll just be like oh okay I was asleep

1467
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:07,600
and even if you were to like take a like to like get some water in your nose or whatever

1468
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:15,060
the only thing that will happen is that like you'll recoil cough and get up like that's just going to be your instinct

1469
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:20,580
and you'll be in you'll be in discomfort for a while but you'll be fine

1470
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:28,490
the only way you're drowning in a drowning in the bathtub is if somebody else is the one doing the drowning

1471
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:29,180
oh

1472
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,500
i feel like

1473
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,640
yeah that would suck from horror movies

1474
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:39,280
i put my head down in the bathtub to wash my hair and I'm it's like underwater

1475
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:44,310
I'm like oh my god there could be something like above me right now looking at me and I can't even know

1476
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:52,390
no I relate to you there's have you guys seen on perfectly cut charts which is that two other accounts that I mentioned on stream all the time

1477
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:55,980
there's a video of this dude who's like me trying to catch the ghost in my shower lacking

1478
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:59,220
it's a guy in the bathroom just kind of like hanging out like not paying attention

1479
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:04,740
he turns around and just punches the fuck out of his shower curtains so hard he just falls

1480
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:15,170
but did you know if if you actually splash water in someone's face while they're sleeping

1481
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:22,820
and they have like a whole like a whole five-hour drowning scene in their in their dreams

1482
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,550
and they finally wake up it works

1483
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,130
can I do that to someone

1484
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:30,710
oh my god that's just this is how it is

1485
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:34,510
i don't believe that so I want someone to do it yeah I do that's you

1486
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:35,730
I wanna see

1487
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:39,510
i wanna I wanna experience if that's the case

1488
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:44,320
because like in your dreams it it takes it feels a lot longer

1489
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:49,670
than it is oh yeah it does yeah like seven seconds could be like five hours

1490
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,370
didn't they do that in inception

1491
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,980
oh that's their whole thing right like you go into a dream and then it's longer

1492
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,240
i never watch that movie

1493
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:10,340
it's probably like a whole drowning like shipwreck scene and then like five hours and they finally wake up and like

1494
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:12,130
water on me

1495
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:18,470
fun fact about that movie I believe that at some occasion when it was being broadcast on japanese television

1496
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:27,200
they actually added like a little thing in the top corner of the screen to like tell the viewers what the dream level they were at at any given time

1497
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:31,470
if they thought it would be too confusing otherwise

1498
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:35,790
oh

1499
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:51,740
yeah like what is this baby o'clock you haven't watched inception if you don't if you don't forget what the top level of the dream is

1500
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:58,860
you know you're just there and you think like oh yeah they're in the facility right now and then they go back and they're on the plane and you're like

1501
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,090
you know like that's just what it's like

1502
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:09,620
i remember watching the film but also i was like not awake because

1503
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,950
i was watching it baby driver

1504
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:18,170
yeah was so fucking good such a good fucking film

1505
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:20,070
baby driver was dank

1506
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:25,780
you haven't seen a tv filmed and like edited to the beat of songs

1507
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:30,990
so like every gun every like door closed is like to the beat of the background music

1508
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:31,850
it's really good

1509
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:39,140
there's like there's an arms deal gone wrong where people shoot each other to this to the tune of I shit you not the tune of tequila

1510
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,620
right yeah like guns going off like

1511
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:58,920
like from the very beginning where it's like where he's just in there he's in the car waiting because the main character is a getaway driver

1512
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:06,380
and all the people are in like robbing a bank and he's in this song and he's like what's up ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you about

1513
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:10,030
the fabulous most groovy

1514
01:39:10,030 --> 01:39:14,840
bale bottoms oh my god I love it so

1515
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,700
I want to watch the film again now

1516
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,460
it's really rewatchable honestly yeah it is

1517
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:23,690
that's the thing I love movies like that that you can get so much out of repeated watches

1518
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,980
and he just says it's over leon

1519
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:41,080
i just um how to train your dragon pawn

1520
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:45,050
movie

1521
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,420
it looks cute though I don't know

1522
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:51,470
it's literally my favorite movie of all time oh my god Luca I love you

1523
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:00,800
but it's still good

1524
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,060
oh I've only seen the first one that

1525
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,960
that's that's my favorite

1526
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,350
even like you guys are talking about such good movies even onigiri is getting excited

1527
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:12,480
and I don't know a more sarcastic and upset person

1528
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:18,540
did I have dragons actually really good though

1529
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:23,530
the the little mini series they had

1530
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:25,660
oh I never saw that unfortunately

1531
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:29,980
was it even about because I've never heard I've heard of it but I've never really looked into it

1532
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:36,120
you ever seen like e.t or like any other movie but they're like hiding the pet from the parents or whatever

1533
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,940
kind of like that but it's like that but it's a dragon yeah

i don't know that one roses are red violets are blue

1546

1547
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,740
group watch the lorax

1548
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:55,980
I'm sorry I'm going to be thinking about roses already violets are blue and dinosaurs

1549
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:14,510
okay okay I got a question

1550
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:16,820
either watercolor pepsi or cook

1551
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,390
coke every day

1552
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:29,490
immediately my fault Luca but then i drunk too much pepsi and now I can taste the difference

1553
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:30,550
pepsi

1554
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:32,590
coke is better by far coke is better

1555
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:37,180
i will like I don't know I'm partial to coke they do taste different though

1556
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:42,050
but the thing is the thing is i don't even think I

1557
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,240
oh there's a coach right there I'll grab it

1558
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,310
yeah same same

1559
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:47,240
everyone ignore the fact

1560
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:51,800
that my clothing has the same color scheme as a bottle of coke

1561
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,060
i think coke is so much better than pepsi

1562
01:42:56,060 --> 01:43:02,760
because pepsi is I don't know how because coke probably has more sugar in it but pepsi feels too sugary

1563
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,510
you know what I mean it is pepsi is way sweeter

1564
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,950
pepsi sweeter even though coke has more actual sugar in it

1565
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:13,050
there might be some regional differences between

1566
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:17,930
that I i think that's very true because my coke is

1567
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:20,100
definitely sweeter than my pepsi

1568
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,040
really

1569
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:31,570
you know the the clerk recipe is actually one of the most highly secure secured and protected uh things in the world

1570
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:35,890
really oh yeah like a big fault

1571
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:38,900
was it there's only two people who know it at a time

1572
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:40,940
yes

1573
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,010
it's kind of crazy

1574
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:46,640
what's the sequence in a video game

1575
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,760
what's the secret recipe to produce Luxiem

1576
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:02,210
of the intro to the powerpuff girls

1577
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:07,320
cringe paul

1578
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:15,910

1580
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,600
plushie

1581
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,430
augustus

1582
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:29,580
is he alive or is it plushy

1583
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,250

1584
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,540
bigger in my stream every single day it

1585
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,810
doesn't move that life

1586
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,080
okay and then a piece of shit

1587
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,210
yeah

1588
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,050
that's how you make money here it is

1589
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:45,900
they become luxia

1590
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:06,060
like sampling of the almond break throughout that entire show whatever any action is happening

1591
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,540
it's so much better than in johnny tess with the whip crack

1592
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:14,900
i never watch much of johnny tests about wow what is my inflection today johnny has

1593
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,750

1594
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:21,620
so like I don't know what the whip crack uh meme is that I see reference the line

1595
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:31,200
I've I've never watched an episode of joining tests but I've seen clips where the whip crack sound effects plays at full volume like three times like five or six times in a minute

1596
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,460
and it's just like wait what's going on

1597
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,120
hey I'm doing okay

1598
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,020
and it's it's scary

1599
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,210
um you have to look this up

1600
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:44,120
crack counter johnny test

1601
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:50,400
that's terrifying one episode

1602
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,960
wait one episode and it's one minute long

1603
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:55,020
what

1604
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,360
that's pretty long because there's just a sound effect

1605
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:02,160
it's a sound effect that's like maybe half a third of a second

1606
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:07,200
wait I'm going to use the russian real quick

1607
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:11,490

1635
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:13,500

1681
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:35,280
here out here

1682
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:41,270
guys would you pick comedy or horror

1683
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:45,060
for uh for me for

1684
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,550
for what for what

1685
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:49,300
in general like if you're watching something

1686
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,980
watching something uh

1687
01:51:51,980 --> 01:51:53,300
comedy or horror

1688
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:57,550
horror I i enjoy comedy but I feel like you can get that from a lot of places

1689
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:05,760
like you laugh when you have friends you laugh when you watch most most films have jokes right

1690
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:11,850
but i mean the ideal is a horror comedy but for which reason you should watch the lighthouse

1691
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:19,700
but um for me I think horror sticks with me the most and it makes me like it kind of I don't know like artistically I find horror more inspiring

1692
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:21,830
but I do love a good comedy

1693
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:26,020
you know I don't know if this is based or not if this is like a base take but like

1694
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:33,720
i think bad horror movies are still scary whereas bad comedy movies I'm not funny

1695
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,330
yeah the thing is that is fucking so true

1696
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:38,750
that is so true

1697
01:52:40,130 --> 01:52:46,690
like the thing about like when a horror movie is still kind of crap

1698
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:54,720
if you're able able to be scared of it then there's still like something there for you to enjoy or like the experience that you're in it for

1699
01:52:54,720 --> 01:53:00,380
when a comedy movie fails at comedy it's nothing but pain

1700
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:03,720
the word is joyless

1701
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:06,780
right yeah joyless joy emoji

1702
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:11,480
joy emoji flat face

1703
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,360
like that that that's it

1704
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:17,560
an unfunny comedy is bad

1705
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:23,510
but an unscary horror movie is still like funny you know what I mean

1706
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:27,130
sometimes unintentionally but still like

1707
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:30,570
i feel like i can never not enjoy a horror movie

1708
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,130
you know

1709
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:41,260
there's actually one horror movie that i like I never walked away from a horror movie thinking like that was genuinely like bad

1710
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:45,060
with the exception of one movie

1711
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,960
am I allowed to say that

1712
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,560
I mean I mean my entire personality is shitting on the lorax

1713
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,590
I'm pretty sure you're allowed to like pick a least favorite film

1714
01:53:53,590 --> 01:54:00,220
there was this really obscure horror movie that for whatever reason like on imdb it was rated like fairly high

1715
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:03,300
so I decided to give it a shot it was called recovery

1716
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:09,330
and the whole movie was about somebody losing their phone and then turning it on recovery mode in order to find it

1717
01:54:09,330 --> 01:54:13,740
and it leads them to this abandoned house where some crazy people live

1718
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:19,850
and it's i don't know why it's just really not great

1719
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:24,230
um

1720
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:34,010
and I just like walked away from it was like really

1721
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:40,570
how how am I gonna watch tick tocks yeah

1722
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:45,030
and check my my my my twitter

1723
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:48,280
you guys can be willy's wonderland

1724
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,260
it's like a nicholas the flat movie yeah

1725
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:58,500
no but with nicolas cage as the stuff the trailer for that made me actually want to commit something

1726
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:04,900
like the fact that the fact that they literally say they're not he's not locked in there with them

1727
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:09,360
they're locked in there with him it was yeah oh it's so gross

1728
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:11,930
I want the real snap movie to come out

1729
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:15,460
oh yeah but like that has been in production for how long now

1730
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:22,060
from from my understanding of it is that like um apparently according to the producer like jason blum blumhouse

1731
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:28,140
like blumhouse makes so many horror movies like a lot of a lot of really good horror movies and some bad ones but whatever

1732
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:34,890
they've said that like the fnaf movie is their highest priority and the main thing is finding a script that scott corton likes

1733
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:38,700
and a lot of the time they'll present him with a script and he'll just be like now

1734
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:43,810
um which I both admire and I don't because it's like yeah the movie is not gonna get made

1735
01:55:43,810 --> 01:55:49,420
but also it means that he loves his franchise enough that he has the integrity to be like this is not good no

1736
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,020
um

1737
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:56,410
i just I wanna I wanna I wanna see i wanna see something like springtrap in that movie

1738
01:55:56,410 --> 01:56:02,820
because his I think that's one of like the most violent villain deaths like possible you know

1739
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:06,420
like an animatronic suit closing on somebody

1740
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,870
holy shit that's grim as hell you know

1741
01:56:09,870 --> 01:56:13,060
and like the way the way it's depicted in like fan culture as well

1742
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:16,470
I wanna i wanna see that shit that that'd make for a great movie

1743
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:20,810
the games I don't like do they actually depict it in the game or is it merely impossible

1744
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:25,430
it's it's imp it's it kind of implied so like at the end of an f3

1745
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:32,420
um it's like the ghosts of the children that william afton killed all like kind of corner him in a room and he's like no no

1746
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:38,010
and he hides in the the springlock suit that he used to kill all of the kids

1747
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:44,150
and the thing about a springlock suit is that is that it's like an animatronic that you can kind of wind a crank

1748
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:49,600
and then the animatronic circuits sort of open up and you can get inside and use it like a costume

1749
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:56,880
um and so it's both but if the spring locks fail it just snaps shut and kind of just crushes you inside

1750
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:03,400
and he jumps inside it hoping that he can like scare off the ghosts of these kids that he's killed

1751
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:09,600
but because the building is so old the the ceiling leaks the joints get um get wet

1752
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:13,260
and suddenly the whole thing just kind of collapses on him

1753
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,870
and it's like all it is is him getting in the suit and laughing for a bit

1754
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:23,010
and suddenly it's like and like there's this weird bit crushed sound effect and all this blood starts pouring everywhere

1755
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:27,690
and it's like there's this one audio of someone having like voice acted it

1756
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:35,130
and it's like him laughing and then suddenly you hear this like like and he goes like ah and like the screaming is so real

1757
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:37,660
it's really really fucking violent

1758
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:44,740
and like if they wanted to make a horror movie they need to put that shit in there because it's so it's so scary

1759
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:49,950
like the idea of being inside a suit that just closes on you and then that that that's it

1760
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:53,120
you know like it's it's fucking horrifying but I don't know

1761
01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:01,180
again we're back here with the Vox problem of everything coming back to five nights at freddy's

1762
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:05,010
there is a enough

1763
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:10,820
jesse have you solved the five threats

1764
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:17,120
actually mr white I do believe I have back in 1963 william halfton created fredbear's family diner

1765
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:27,050
no that's actually a question in there

1766
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:30,000
oh okay uh nuts or no nuts

1767
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,760
no nuts I'm not a fan

1768
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,160
really yeah

1769
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:38,020
it depends like again

1770
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:40,150
um not from the nut tree

1771
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:43,360
in chocolate fuck no I don't like nutty chocolate but

1772
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:50,880
yeah no I don't like hazelnut chocolate i don't like nutella I prefer chocolate spread just regular chocolate spread I'm sorry

1773
01:58:52,470 --> 01:58:53,760
no good

1774
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,360
but stir-fry

1775
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:01,270
cashews and stir-fry yes please

1776
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:02,880
yes please

1777
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,100
unbased chocolate

1778
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:09,750
i think it's like a thing back home that we had called the

1779
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:16,520
toffee fae or whatever does anybody know what that is toffee is that how you say it called well coffee fee

1780
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,680
see everyone chad's calling me based right

1781
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:22,340
like like like like like nutty chocolate I'm not a fan of

1782
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:25,900
but like come on cashews and stir-fry you can't really say no to that come on

1783
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:29,970
some people are typing banned toffifee or however you pronounce it

1784
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:32,140
that has like nuts in it

1785
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:37,440
and for whatever reason that works for me like that that's the only time I'll have like nuts with anything

1786
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,740
he doesn't have a good nut

1787
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:41,070
pistachio is good

1788
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:44,720
i like pistachios

1789
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,850
wait pistachio and nut too

1790
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:49,340
yeah yeah green type of knot

1791
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:53,180
pistachios and not cashews or not

1792
01:59:55,890 --> 02:00:01,470
um we had this exact same conversation me or somebody else

1793
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:02,850
well I played uno

1794
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:07,640
Luca Luca was like

1795
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:14,100
what what do you mean there's so much why are there so many nuts I i only thought there were peanuts

1796
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:17,760
yeah I only eat peanuts though

1797
02:00:18,850 --> 02:00:22,340
i mean

1798
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:28,020
they look the same but I thought they would just hold that and process like differently

1799
02:00:29,030 --> 02:00:32,000
that's how oh like all peanuts were like all right

1800
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,800
what the heck happened Lucas sounded like he just got shot

1801
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:39,300
what yeah i like mario when he dies

1802
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:46,420
i was waving my recorder around and it hit my knee again

1803
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:47,920
oh my god

1804
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:51,960
that's my absolute favorite thing about Luxiem

1805
02:00:51,960 --> 02:01:02,200
is the fact that like the detective like the presid that the the arm of the law is the most corrupt and like unsafe member of the group

1806
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:08,700
and then the member of the mafia who's supposed to have committed multiple crimes is just a pure beacon of light

1807
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:13,930
that's not true

1808
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,770
oh go go on

1809
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:19,700
i jump

1810
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:32,630
my profession a little bit too high to be right perfect

1811
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:36,320
when have you ever

1812
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,500

1814
02:01:47,010 --> 02:01:49,040
can't cast a spell twice

1815
02:01:56,630 --> 02:02:03,020
you know like I don't trust my trust my sorcery 100 though what if it goes wrong right

1816
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:08,310
if it goes wrong maybe I'll just be horny for Ike in like a hateful way

1817
02:02:08,310 --> 02:02:11,200
you know and then we'll have great hate sex it'll be great

1818
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,660
oh

1819
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:35,300
that theme bomb on battlefield it's so good

1820
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,720
um

1821
02:02:52,060 --> 02:02:57,240
yeah I don't think there's any game more nostalgic than mario 64.

1822
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:58,750
i know I played it

1823
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:01,720
oh how are you doing

1824
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:06,280
it's like do you like platformers do you like platforms it's kind of old though

1825
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:09,770
it's old but like okay okay mr mister do you like platformers

1826
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:13,780
um i can't say I've really played many to be

1827
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:19,750
64 was the first 3d platformer that was like good

1828
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:25,840
it also introduced the concept of a camera that because it was the first game to use the term

1829
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,160
like it's such a revolutionary game

1830
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:37,480
playing the original like because I was honestly introduced to it through the ds version which is really different from the nintendo 64 version

1831
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:42,160
the nintendo 64 version feels like you're just stepping into a dream

1832
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:48,790
it's so old but it's so revolutionary at the same time

1833
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:56,620
you know in the same way it mario 64 did for video games what 2001 a space odyssey did for films

1834
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:01,260
you know what I mean like it's so wacky and new but also so old

1835
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:08,760
but all in a way that it doesn't feel that old because the controls and the graphics still feel enjoyable today

1836
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:15,870
in the same way that the camera work and the story of 2001 holds up in film today like it's it's weird

1837
02:04:15,870 --> 02:04:20,700
but like dude like mario 64 is a is an enigma

1838
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:23,460
you've you have to play it it's beautiful

1839
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,620
I've never

1840
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:31,340
I've no I don't play that I've only seen um what's his name mischief like speed on the game

1841
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,850
oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

1842
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:39,370
i remember do you guys seen that clip of him trying to get the backwards long jump to get into the the top oh yeah yeah yeah

1843
02:04:39,370 --> 02:04:43,680
he can't get it and then emiru gets it first right he's like

1844
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,260
backwards long jumps

1845
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:56,310
mario backwards long jumps through your wall to wish you a merry christmas

1846
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:05,600
it is sat there halfway through a bottle of wine alone feeling unloved on christmas and then you hear

1847
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:08,800
yeah yeah yeah yeah

1848
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,900
all of a sudden christmas is saved

1849
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:16,180
the all blj the backwoods long jump

1850
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:43,280
do you all know the trick in uh in the in this game that you could do a backwards long jump in school

1851
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:44,340
I can't hear you

1852
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:46,760
huge stuff that's oh

1853
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:49,710
shoo

1854
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:55,320
do you know that you could skip a huge section in this game by doing a backwards long jam

1855
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:58,540
but before we elaborate further

1856
02:05:58,540 --> 02:06:01,000
we need to talk about parallel universes

1857
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:16,740
yeah on the undertale stairs at the beginning in the ruins you could do a backwards long jump and skip the whole cutscene

1858
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:20,240
was anyone else like really really unnerved by that part

1859
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:21,820
like when you're good

1860
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:25,230
like my first time playing I thought it would turn into a horror game I was really scared

1861
02:06:25,230 --> 02:06:26,270
oh me too

1862
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:30,360
wait what part when you go down um

1863
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:37,160
yeah it really freaks me out

1864
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:42,380

1912
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:21,140
I'm just vibing though

1913
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:30,620
am I the only one that sometimes just like not because I'm hungry like I eat things just because I want something to do oh

1914
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:37,840
yes that happens a lot that's actually how most people um like start putting on weight

1915
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:40,990
because they are like normal wow mister

1916
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:46,140
okay sure

1917
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:49,670
I'm saying in general in general

1918
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:52,100
oops ouch

1919
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:54,260
dang

1920
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:57,000
bruh

1921
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:01,410
that happens quite a bit to me

1922
02:10:01,410 --> 02:10:04,420
I feel like I should just hang a sign into my fridge

1923
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:10,190
so whenever I open it it's just a sign that hangs there says you're not hungry you're bored shut the damn door

1924
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:14,140
honestly like I've seen a picture of that

1925
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:22,840
ever since we debuted like i haven't this is not bad at all like I'm eating enough obviously

1926
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:25,160
but I'm not eating as much

1927
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:27,170
no

1928
02:10:28,130 --> 02:10:29,580
uh-huh yeah

1929
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:32,760
I can kind of relate to that I don't like eat as much either

1930
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:36,320
like I feel like the most I do is like sleep

1931
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,420
I've been sleeping a lot more

1932
02:10:38,420 --> 02:10:39,510
really

1933
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:40,680
I've been sleeping less

1934
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:45,250
I've also been sleeping less I went to sleep at 7 00 am the other day

1935
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:47,090
i sleep whenever

1936
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:52,250
it's like I've been sleeping more but in shorter like increments

1937
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:58,840
because for whatever reason I'm not I don't fall I fall into deep sleep as uh as much as I used to

1938
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:05,160
and as a result I've been having a lot more dreams which unfortunately when it comes to me isn't is usually a bad thing

1939
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:07,500
because my dreams are oh

1940
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:23,220
my eating stuff is not bad at all like I'm eating enough I'm sleeping enough just not as much

1941
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:25,340
as uh

1942
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:26,520
it was before debut

1943
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:32,420
um I kind of get what I mean whenever for me like

1944
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:36,550
i don't know before i got here

1945
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:40,460
i was just sort of like living to do stuff

1946
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:47,500
and then when you start streaming and when you have like this schedule and when you want to do gorilla streams you want to do all this stuff

1947
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:52,940
for me I will wake up to do a stream and then when I'm not streaming and i have one in the evening

1948
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:58,920
my body will be like all right you need to rest go back to sleep for like three hours and then stream

1949
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:05,680
and so for me it's like if I'm awake I'm streaming if I'm not streaming it's like yo go to sleep

1950
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:08,660
yeah

1951
02:12:08,660 --> 02:12:18,680
like I mean the reason why I don't eat like a lot anymore is uh because your streams usually go for a long time

1952
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:22,560
and if if I eat before that I'm not really burning that off

1953
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,210
so that's right

1954
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:26,060
yeah that's why

1955
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:29,720

1960
02:13:00,700 --> 02:13:06,450
i just remember by the way Vox like during that whole um

1961
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:08,910
are you seriously watching youtubers by yourself like

1962
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:18,300
what prompted you to do that motorboating sound like the first time i heard it it absolutely shattered me like i was cry laughing

1963
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:20,020
I don't remember what happened

1964
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:23,660
I think it's like before because I tried to I tried I tried being like

1965
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:30,710
like but whenever I did it and you enjoyed it my voice would break and it just kind of wouldn't work

1966
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:31,960
so I was just like

1967
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:41,170
and then like that that right there is like the majority of what I can do so right as my voice started to like her i would go like

1968
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:47,010
and then suddenly like that would just kind of carry me ahead

1969
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:55,840
you know what I mean like it's the way that you did it because like there was like a note underneath it so like it had like like underneath it

1970
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:02,550
like moving back and forth like it absolutely killed me

1971
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:12,520
like it was so bad like like it killed me on my first view and because it was on twitter it started looping

1972
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:17,370
so it was like mercilessly just beating and kicking me while I was down

1973
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:25,540
it's like I think it's more of a simpsons motorboat where he's like yeah

1974
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:37,160
like nothing quite comes close to it it's like that lightning in a bottle on the one that ended up in the final cut it's so good

1975
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:51,380
why

1976
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:53,930
because you were like oh I was crying laughing

1977
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:56,490
oh don't you mean joy emoji

1978
02:14:56,490 --> 02:14:59,780

1985
02:15:30,700 --> 02:15:34,080
i think I've got more organized as time's gone on

1986
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:39,100

even though like some of our listeners or viewers i should say and like um take some of our most cursed moments

2033
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:36,900
they make like amazing art with it art animation and whatnot

2034
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:44,860
like like the creative and creativity on display is impeccable but my ears are hearing cursed things

2035
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:54,780
wait it's you know it's such a contrast or like what's the cognitive dissonance

2036
02:18:54,780 --> 02:18:55,860
um yes

2037
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,960
um you know Vox you said earlier like donate to the other guys

2038
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:01,950
mm-hmm

2039
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:07,620
i got a donation just now and I just want I kind of have to read this because I'm kind of scared

2040
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:09,360
no boy

2041
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:12,110
you angel full stop

2042
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:14,240
you precious darling boy

2043
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:17,160
you adorable thing I would die for you

2044
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:20,840
I would kill in all capitals for you

2045
02:19:20,840 --> 02:19:23,580
she's a precious precious darling angel

2046
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:24,680
you're adorable

2047
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:25,890
you're a ray of light

2048
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:29,020
summers sweet summer child frick good

2049
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:30,110
vlogs

2050
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:35,140
I'm not gonna lie

2051
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:38,700
that sounds like okay it's interesting

2052
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:46,580
like mister i think your fans and my fans are sort of on the same level of down bad but for different reasons

2053
02:19:46,580 --> 02:19:48,080
you know what I mean really

2054
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:51,940
like yours you're from that it's like

2055
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:54,520
oh my god

2056
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:57,800
i want to take you into my house and i want to put you in a little house

2057
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,570
I want to put you in a little kettle and just want to take care of you for the rest of your life

2058
02:20:00,570 --> 02:20:01,860
and then my channel

2059
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:07,820
and then my channel like can you please make a sound like you're slapping me up like I've melted into a delicious chicken soup

2060
02:20:11,440 --> 02:20:13,290
no is that

2061
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:21,420
now is that because that's just how they are or is it because of the confession streams you've done

2062
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:25,910
because like if if mr were to have a confession stream I'm sure that would do

2063
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:28,250
well

2064
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:37,400
i

2065
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,940
um

2066
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:42,600
i mean maybe maybe it wouldn't do as well as the original kindred stream

2067
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:44,090
but i think it would

2068
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:48,020
and I think it would i think it would and it would be the same sort of thing

2069
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:51,570
I mean people and people in mine are like I just

2070
02:20:51,570 --> 02:20:56,340
the best one that I remember was from was it akamatitis522

2071
02:20:56,340 --> 02:21:03,920
who was like I want to just smash my face into your titties and then just let you eat your chicken strips and drip buffalo sauce into my hair

2072
02:21:07,470 --> 02:21:08,760
um

2073
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,600
i don't even know what to say to that

2074
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:13,120
it's kind of fog

2075
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:18,130
like part of me is puzzled like how does

2076
02:21:18,130 --> 02:21:24,870
like how how do you develop a dynamic like that with your viewers

2077
02:21:24,870 --> 02:21:29,200
like it it seems it it it's baffling to me it's puzzling

2078
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,100
it's like a riddle I can't solve

2079
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:33,360
I mean that was in my first week

2080
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:37,490
I hadn't done more the first week I hadn't done much at all then

2081
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:43,950
i had I like that it said like by the bonfire so I'd played dark souls 2 and eaten chicken

2082
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:50,120
by the bonfire in dark souls 2 because i was hungry and we'd been streaming for like five and a half hours

2083
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:53,740
so I got some chicken wings with some spicy buffalo sauce and I've been eating them

2084
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:59,610
and they were like yo I want to thrust my head into your titties and just let you drink that buffalo sauce under my hair

2085
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:02,360
and I was like while you were playing dark souls

2086
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:07,250
I was playing dark souls 2 of all games dark souls 2 scholar of the first shit

2087
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:14,510
something tells me that you don't have a very healthy relationship with that game

2088
02:22:15,970 --> 02:22:17,820
after the end of that endurance stream

2089
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:25,800
like my my enjoyment ended when I killed that troll in the tutorial with my bare hands that was fun

2090
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:30,410
and then after that it was just a long painful slog to the rest of it

2091
02:22:30,410 --> 02:22:37,340
i will say though that like that one tweet for you were just looking really like defeated and depressed

2092
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:40,870
and it just said dark souls 2 made me laugh really hard

2093
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:46,280
dark souls 2

2094
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:47,890
dark souls

2095
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,620
um yeah

2096
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:54,780
i kind of want to play dark souls again honestly

2097
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:56,580
which one dark souls 3

2098
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,950
3 yeah

2099
02:22:57,950 --> 02:23:08,400
dark souls 3 is such a good game and to be honest I think it's the best entry point for the souls series because overall it's the least like jank

2100
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:13,720
like you will die if you die it's your own fault I think in dark souls 1 and 2

2101
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:20,460
there are so many times where you'll die and it'll be due to like weird hitboxes or bugs all that kind of stuff

2102
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:25,080
dark holes 3 is very is vicious and hard but very fair

2103
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:29,020
and I think as long as you treat it with as long as you really try

2104
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:33,240
if you beat dark souls 3 you'll be ready for the rest of the series honestly

2105
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:39,100
I'd say go dark souls 3 then try bloodborne then try securo

2106
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:41,670
and then try just what whichever ones you want oh secure

2107
02:23:41,670 --> 02:23:45,960
securo is mechanically the hardest but also the most fair

2108
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:50,660
the boss like the final boss of sakura is the hardest boss I think I've fought in any game

2109
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:52,790
I i love secular i played recently too

2110
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:55,410
sakura is a beautiful game beautiful game

2111
02:23:55,410 --> 02:24:01,740
I hate it after having failed my no death runs in it that many times

2112
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:05,940
but I i still love it you know it's such a beautiful game

2113
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:13,570
secure is nice

2114
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:15,980
i really love how yeah

2115
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:21,450
you can you can just clash the hardest boss I've ever beaten like

2116
02:24:21,450 --> 02:24:34,010
it's it's pretty obscure like and I don't know how much I can talk about because it is very spoiler heavy and the main reason to play the game that it hails from is because of the story

2117
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:41,580
ah I said I i want to like go into detail about any gush about it but i don't want to spoil just say the name of the game I'm the boss

2118
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:45,040
um the final boss of dragon guard three

2119
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:50,600
I know exactly what you're talking about and chat missed it uh mr Ike is absolutely right

2120
02:24:54,030 --> 02:25:01,920
that boss it like it for me I i got it on my fourth try because like you know I'm I'm pretty good with rhythm

2121
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:10,300
uh but I have heard of people like literally being on that boss for months until eventually giving up

2122
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:21,500
uh it is that like if you are not like a person who is like very good with rhythm you're gonna have a really rough time

2123
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:28,260
i I i I don't mean to change topic i just wanted to point this out quickly for a second

2124
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:30,220
yeah go for it

2125
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:31,740
the donation I read out

2126
02:25:32,690 --> 02:25:38,960
uh you know the one that was like I'm precious or whatever they just donated again

2127
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:41,800
but oh they donated five hundred dollars

2128

from zero and zero jdk shannary m peepee

2136
02:26:27,740 --> 02:26:32,620
one of my favorite clips is um someone asked me like

02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:38,110
hey you know can I have some advice for like someone i really loved rejected me recently

2138

2139
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:49,140

like Vox asked

2145
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:14,780
to present one thing that represents myself and I i got this poop so

2146
02:27:24,890 --> 02:27:30,990
when you say that word and you replace the last letter with the letter d

2147
02:27:30,990 --> 02:27:35,420
i don't know why but it just tickles my fancy in just the right way it's so funny

2148
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:36,710
shid

2149
02:27:36,710 --> 02:27:39,120

2227
02:32:37,370 --> 02:32:40,320
okay now let's do what shu properly said

2228
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,080
yes

2229
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,270
first impression

2230
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:45,890
first impression of you ike

2231
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:48,080
i think

2232
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:49,800
uh

2233
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:54,530
i don't know you you have quite a friendly voice right so like

2234
02:32:54,530 --> 02:32:55,580
i think um

2235
02:32:56,420 --> 02:33:02,140
immediately I was like okay I think the other least intimidating to me to to message

2236
02:33:03,210 --> 02:33:04,980
so I think yeah

2237
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:07,660
but I think our first message together was like really

2238
02:33:08,690 --> 02:33:12,510
really corporate

2239
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:15,050
was it right it probably was

2240
02:33:15,050 --> 02:33:16,430
yeah

2241
02:33:16,430 --> 02:33:18,420
that was my first impression of you

2242
02:33:18,420 --> 02:33:20,710
reading first messages now too

2243
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:24,110
oh god I don't know if we have to go that far

2244
02:33:24,110 --> 02:33:26,180
okay

2245
02:33:27,630 --> 02:33:33,550
for some reason when I first heard your voice I couldn't tell why but I thought you were from hawaii

2246
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:39,140
oh yeah we had the whole conversation wait yeah I remember you saying that

2247
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:42,070
i couldn't tell why but from the very beginning

2248
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:49,370
i just I i don't know why but I felt like I just thought you were really cute

2249
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:51,830
oh

2250
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:55,710
i was like man whoever this guy is

2252
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:02,530

well

2257
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:25,110
it's kind of the same as missed that like I i thought um Ike was actually going to be a very quiet type

2258
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:29,290
but not really chat

2259
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:37,640

2260
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:40,810

2261
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:42,970

rxdc

2265
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:56,560
rxdxdxd

2266
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:58,890
my first impression

2267
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:03,400
honestly

2268
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:09,020
i think the only thing that was on my mind when i first

2269
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:13,920
my first impression that just comes to mind is you're ordering pizza

2270
02:35:14,460 --> 02:35:16,820
oh yeah I did do that

2271
02:35:16,820 --> 02:35:18,750
pumpkin then we were like guys

2272
02:35:18,750 --> 02:35:23,990
I've just decided you're like what pizza did you order and then you said hawaiian pizza

2273
02:35:23,990 --> 02:35:26,320
and that's my no no

2274
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:28,450
wait I didn't order oh no we asked

2275
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:33,330
oh no no we were like did you order hawaiian pizza because we think you're from hawaii for some reason

2276
02:35:33,330 --> 02:35:35,340
and I i said no

2277
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:38,050
and then okay that's my first impression though

2278
02:35:39,010 --> 02:35:40,760
yes I was the pizza dude

2279
02:35:44,310 --> 02:35:46,720
yeah okay my first impression of mista

2280
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:54,680
i thought you were very like quiet and reserved

2281
02:35:55,380 --> 02:36:00,940
but then like when we started like speaking a little bit more like it properly in voice calls

2282
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:05,390
i started to notice the the say sus

2283
02:36:05,390 --> 02:36:06,840
oh yeah

2284
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:08,230
yeah yeah yeah

2285
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:15,510
because like like every little opportunity to sneak in an innuendo like mister would jump on that in a heartbeat

2286
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:19,890
and it like slowly it started to form like his his brand

2287
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:24,570
so like I started seeing glimpses of his true power I guess

2288
02:36:24,570 --> 02:36:31,640
and then when I saw him like in action on stream I was just really impressed because oh my god you are such an entertainer

2289
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:35,640
it was I was in awe it was inspiring to watch

2290
02:36:36,210 --> 02:36:37,150
thanks

2291
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:43,150
see sauce

2292
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:49,760
all right dad what do you got for me

2293
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:53,210
see mister

2294
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:56,760
at the very beginning I wasn't sure what to make of you

2295
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:02,280
because the first thing that I knew about you was the fact that in slack

2296
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:09,040
you set your status to I'm scared of social interaction and I was like man this guy's this guy's quirky

2297
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,710
and but the the truth is

2298
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:23,360
when I when I actually got around to knowing you I think that you're you're the kind of person who is closed off from the outside but fiery and exciting on the inside

2299
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:26,860
and whenever we spoke you're active

2300
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:31,020
you're funny you're exciting and I think

2301
02:37:31,020 --> 02:37:34,020
i don't I don't think I've ever met anyone quite like you

2302
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:39,680
and I know I like to bully you but maybe it's because today's your birthday and I'm feeling quite emotional

2303
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:42,780
but to be honest I think that you're a very special person

2304
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:47,620
and if you are scared even if you are scared of social interaction

2305
02:37:47,620 --> 02:37:52,450
the social interactions you had with me were really quite something

2306
02:37:52,450 --> 02:37:54,820
so thank you mister I think you're really cool

2307
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:14,400
mr was very quiet and like

2308
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:20,790
yeah I i think the other guys can speak can back me up on that

2309
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:29,960
and like the more I got to know him like i don't know I feel like I can send mr anything

2310
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:31,610
you said

2311
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:35,500
that was content

2312
02:38:36,310 --> 02:38:37,550
like uh yeah yeah like

2313
02:38:38,130 --> 02:38:41,590
at the beginning I i wouldn't think I'd be able to do that with you

2314
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:43,760
yeah but uh

2315
02:38:44,430 --> 02:38:47,640
yeah like one day we were on the call

2316
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:51,090
we were talking about thanos

2317
02:38:51,090 --> 02:38:52,940
and I just sent it to mister

2318
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:56,610
like a whole picture of ben or snake

2319
02:38:58,040 --> 02:38:58,870
yeah

2320
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:01,790
Luca has sent mystic

2321
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:04,050
oh my gosh

2322
02:39:04,050 --> 02:39:06,470
Luca sent me there

2323
02:39:06,470 --> 02:39:09,980
there was a reason why we did that okay we were talking about it

2324
02:39:09,980 --> 02:39:16,110
yeah you're like have you seen that this uh the thanos discord image

2325
02:39:16,810 --> 02:39:20,550
and we look we all looked for it in google images and send it to each other

2326
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:24,110
oh my god

2327
02:39:24,110 --> 02:39:28,030
uh no Ike was the only one who didn't know what the fantastic was

2328
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:29,610
why would I know

2329
02:39:29,610 --> 02:39:31,390
i didn't know either

2330
02:39:31,390 --> 02:39:33,520
or I don't did i

2331
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:38,110
i think I don't think I was I don't think I was there during the

2332
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:43,490
i would have preferred to remain blissfully unaware but I think these guys didn't like me

2333
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:45,320
i might have been there

2334
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,600
like I i

2335
02:39:47,330 --> 02:39:49,360
i recognized the phrase

2336
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:52,020
i think that's about it yeah

2337
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:55,500
why is this a phrase like why is this no

2338
02:39:57,780 --> 02:40:00,160
oh no I i have some friends that say stuff like that

2339
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:02,530
but anyways my first impression

2340
02:40:02,530 --> 02:40:08,780
i think so do y'all remember when uh we had that one meeting and the manager's son was like

2341
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:11,280
now you're officially part of ninja sanji welcome

2342
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:18,280
yeah I remember that and then that's when i first heard mr go

2343
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:19,900
let's

2344
02:40:26,420 --> 02:40:32,230
yeah yeah like you know usually once when they say like welcome to this or like welcome to that

2345
02:40:32,230 --> 02:40:36,510
like usually i think your response is supposed to be like oh thank you I'm glad to be here

2346
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:39,910
you know those kind of things but like literally what we did was like

2347
02:40:39,910 --> 02:40:44,210
let's go let's go boys yeah we got it yeah let's go baby let's go let's go

2348
02:40:49,250 --> 02:40:51,140
yeah that's literally

2349
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:53,390
how we reacted we pogged

2350
02:40:53,390 --> 02:40:55,320
but yeah um so

2351
02:40:56,220 --> 02:41:03,600
um out of that I think i remember miss does let's go being like the most

2352
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,950
i think it was the first one

2353
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:06,710
yeah I think it was the first one

2354
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:09,020
and i was like oh like yeah let's go baby

2355
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:14,270
like I followed up and stuff but I think that's my first impression I was like oh yeah

2356
02:41:14,270 --> 02:41:19,460
this is how and kind of as a whole i was like oh yeah this is how loxim is going to be

2357
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:25,460
logging says

2358
02:41:25,460 --> 02:41:27,690
yeah yeah exactly

2359
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:29,010
exactly

2360
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:34,370

02:41:34,370 --> 02:41:35,860
huh oh shit all right

2362
02:41:36,770 --> 02:41:38,940

de monkey

2364
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:46,740

2365
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:49,990
I'm like I mean no offense but I was kind of scared of you

2366
02:41:49,990 --> 02:41:51,670
oh

2367
02:41:51,670 --> 02:41:57,680
why you were a little bit i don't know like it wasn't that just like oh like like a deep intimidating voice

2368
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:01,240
it's just like you seemed so in control

2369
02:42:01,240 --> 02:42:07,170
like when I heard you speak I just knew that oh my god this is somebody that probably knows exactly what they're doing

2370
02:42:07,170 --> 02:42:12,990
like has a roadmap figured out for everything planned into every little minute to detail

2371
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:23,380
and just I i just knew that like oh my god he's gonna be so successful successful and everybody's gonna like like fawn over him his looks his voice and everything

2372
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:25,990
and just to some extent I was correct

2373
02:42:25,990 --> 02:42:30,830
but now you're to me at least not intimidating

2374
02:42:30,830 --> 02:42:35,950
you're like a big cuddly teddy bear you're just such a comfy person to be around

2375
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:38,510
you're always gassing me and the others of Luxiem up

2376
02:42:38,510 --> 02:42:44,720
and like just the everybody in ian you're such a positive force that's just constantly present

2377
02:42:45,710 --> 02:42:47,620
you're gonna make me cry

2378
02:42:51,120 --> 02:43:01,910
i distinctly remember like when we were like I was being nervous like uh before we uh we were announced with debuts and everything

2379
02:43:01,910 --> 02:43:05,620
and you you said something I don't remember the exact topic but you said something

2380
02:43:05,620 --> 02:43:08,070
it's just king supporting kings don't even mention it

2381
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:10,950
and i that just stuck with me

2382
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:15,080
that's yeah that's it you know

2383
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:17,190
you got you guys are all a load of kings

2384
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:19,280
you've worked so hard to be here

2385
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:21,340
of course

2386
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:34,740
you posted cringe

2387
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:41,700
well my first impression of vlogs was pretty similar to that

2388
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:45,340
in a sense that he seemed like

2389
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:48,560
and I don't mean this in a bad way for everyone

2390
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:56,690
I just mean like he seemed like he knew the most about what what he was doing like leading the group in a way

2391
02:43:56,690 --> 02:44:02,950
um like in the cools like when we were doing like uh our meetings and stuff

2392
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:08,610
it kind of felt like okay he's like like I can rely on him you know

2393
02:44:08,610 --> 02:44:14,370
like if he if he has like an opinion on something that we're we're doing like kind of like oh okay yeah

2394
02:44:15,510 --> 02:44:16,730
i I kind of agree

2395
02:44:18,370 --> 02:44:20,840
yeah like the dad of the group

2396
02:44:21,790 --> 02:44:24,280
um that was my first impression I was like

2397
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:29,550
oh oh actually i wouldn't say I was scared of your voice

2398
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:32,930
um but i was intrigued I guess

2399
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:36,500
oh I was like i couldn't

2400
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,100
oh you sneaky little devil

2401
02:44:38,100 --> 02:44:41,330
american

2402
02:44:41,330 --> 02:44:43,300
i had to like kind of message you

2403
02:44:44,390 --> 02:44:49,490
and then and then of course we were two brits and I was like brit's got to stick up yeah yeah

2404
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:56,670
yeah because I really wasn't it was hard to discern like everyone's accents and i didn't want to ask to be like

2405
02:44:56,670 --> 02:44:59,410
I don't know I thought it might have been rude to ask for everyone

2406
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:02,290
so I kind of just yeah

2407
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,710
I'm really learning time

2408
02:45:05,430 --> 02:45:06,470
american

2409
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:11,060
healthy yeehaw

2410
02:45:12,450 --> 02:45:16,990
yeah as for my case I i thought fox was gonna be well

2411
02:45:16,990 --> 02:45:21,810
still is like one of the mature ones of the group

2412
02:45:21,810 --> 02:45:25,460
uh when he's when he first started speaking actually

2413
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:32,710
because yeah like uh like what mr said he he would actually lead the meetings sometimes

2414
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:36,680
yeah like if if he had a question he would just go go and say it

2415
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:39,780
and stuff like that and

2416
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:44,080
that that's why he gave me that impression

2417
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:48,840
but now this is very sassy very sunny

2418
02:45:53,310 --> 02:45:56,210
yeah he's uh he's very kind very very kind

2419
02:45:57,270 --> 02:45:58,580
and very supportive

2420
02:45:58,580 --> 02:46:00,120
thank you

2421
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:05,900
my first impression

2422
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:07,340
uh

2423
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:10,640
i think the one thing that really stuck to me was like

2424
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:19,310
when um after our first meeting like we didn't even we didn't have any like contact information of each other yet within the group

2425
02:46:19,310 --> 02:46:24,310
and then and then fox was like so when are we when are we able to contact each other

2426
02:46:24,310 --> 02:46:28,350
when are we getting our own group chat when are we whenever we chat and you know

2427
02:46:28,350 --> 02:46:32,300
like Vox was always the guy who asks like uh

2428
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:36,170
oh no oh no I want to meet my gem mates you know

2429
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:49,250
yeah yeah yeah like that was that was my first impression I was like oh oh yeah he's probably a friendly person you know uh wants to just know

2430
02:46:49,250 --> 02:46:54,610
i guess very socially active I guess is the way I'd imagine

2431
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:57,150
was my first impression yes

2432
02:46:58,710 --> 02:47:03,740
man you guys are so sweet yeah what the fuck

2433
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:10,300
I'm supposed to I'm supposed terrifying 400 year old demon from hell

2434
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:13,360
and you're all like hey this I i like this guy and I'm like

2435
02:47:17,560 --> 02:47:19,870
don't worry about it it's just king supporting kings

2436
02:47:28,700 --> 02:47:33,480
thank you guys whenever whenever I have a tough week I know I couldn't rely on you guys so thank you

2437
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,480
hog rivers

2438
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:36,300
oh

2439
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:46,950
thing yes that

2440
02:47:46,950 --> 02:47:47,920
um

2441
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:56,840
i had a little bit of a hard time like like what's the word I'm looking for

2442
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:01,040
like nailing down what kind of personality you had in the beginning

2443
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:06,630
because I feel like along with mr you were also a little bit quiet in the beginning

2444
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:09,540
but once we got started talking a bit

2445
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:18,560
i could like see like I could feel the sort of like like really upbeat energy that you can't uh tend to have

2446
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:23,420
like you told us about how you were really good at getting over it and we were like no way

2447
02:48:23,420 --> 02:48:27,950
and then he just went on stream and beat it in like no time at all right in front of us

2448
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:30,270
and we were just kind of left speechless

2449
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:35,100
and I also remember the first time you told us like about lucy

2450
02:48:35,100 --> 02:48:36,580
and I was just like there's no way

2451
02:48:36,580 --> 02:48:44,440
like like I was like okay you know what then like give him like show it off like like let's see what you got

2452
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:49,190
and I was just blown away with your fluency in grill

2453
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:53,460
yeah I i I did the bed with them I think

2454
02:48:53,460 --> 02:48:59,990
and yeah like it's like it still surprises me to this day like how blown away I was with that

2455
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:07,310
and but like I didn't really get like like a firm like uh grasp on you as a whole

2456
02:49:07,310 --> 02:49:11,120
until like we started getting real close to debut and started talking a lot more

2457
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:13,670
because that's when your like the whole

2458
02:49:13,670 --> 02:49:22,110
the era of pog started like really clicking with me because the occasional pogs that I caught never really stuck with me

2459
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:26,980
but after a while I started realizing wait a second there's a pattern here

2460
02:49:28,570 --> 02:49:33,370
and now here we are and it's slowly starting to spread to the rest of the eg ends

2461
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:39,900
is

2462
02:49:39,900 --> 02:49:46,430
yo like there's one time somebody uh somebody was posting like a clip of Luca translated but they didn't translate pog

2463
02:49:47,270 --> 02:49:48,640
oh owl

2464
02:49:48,640 --> 02:49:52,640
japanese japanese japanese pog japanese japanese japanese

2465
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:56,600
subtitles

2466
02:49:57,380 --> 02:49:59,110
they just could add a translation note for it

2467
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:02,520
like they don't even have the translation though it's just pog

2468
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:04,830
oh no they just assume they just assume

2469
02:50:04,830 --> 02:50:06,120
it's universal

2470
02:50:07,230 --> 02:50:08,000
it is

2471
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:12,920
oh god I appreciate that I like thank you thank you thank you

2472
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:14,610
thank you

2473
02:50:15,150 --> 02:50:17,010
first impression of Luca

2474
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:21,220
again I couldn't tell where everyone was from when we first started speaking

2475
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:26,650
and you know the first ever times we all heard each other's voices I think

2476
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:31,440
we weren't you know we were all kind of silent for most of the call

2477
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:32,330
you know

2478
02:50:32,330 --> 02:50:38,250
so it was kind of hard to even tell much about each other until we got into the slack

2479
02:50:38,250 --> 02:50:41,650
and then I think that's when i

2480
02:50:43,390 --> 02:50:50,650
started getting in front yeah but like uh i think and I was intimidated by Luca actually

2481
02:50:50,650 --> 02:50:53,100
uh oh

2482
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:56,670
and I messaged him on slack

2483
02:50:56,670 --> 02:51:02,810
and like because I messaged like everyone right like I at least tried to like kind of slide in a little bit

2484
02:51:02,810 --> 02:51:05,400
if it wasn't in a group chat then it was in dms

2485
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:10,280
and i messaged Lucarin in slack like dms

2486
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:14,000
and he like didn't reply for like quite a few hours

2487
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,520
and I was like oh god does he hate me

2488
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:19,720
but I think it's because it was time zone oh no

2489
02:51:19,720 --> 02:51:20,920
oh wait

2490
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:23,230
like for something

2491
02:51:23,230 --> 02:51:27,720
in that case I i missed your message for like a whole three days

2492
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:30,710
the first one

2493
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:42,390
yeah I'm pretty sure you fell asleep

2494
02:51:43,190 --> 02:51:44,360
but

2495
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:48,200
it stopped I stopped being intimidated when we actually started talking

2496
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:49,890
um hey

2497
02:51:49,890 --> 02:51:55,090
the moment you added the sassy emote to a comeback oh god that thing

2498
02:51:55,090 --> 02:51:56,740
yeah

2499
02:51:56,740 --> 02:52:00,080
i was like okay this person is not intimidating at all

2500
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,460
yeah

2501
02:52:10,460 --> 02:52:18,090
oh I remember that time when you

2502
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:28,660
i didn't realize until like I think shu pointed it out

2503
02:52:28,660 --> 02:52:30,360
yeah and it took a screenshot

2504
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:34,840
okay

2505
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:37,200
it was genuinely hilarious

2506
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:47,330
yeah

2507
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:54,370
my my first impression of Luca to be honest I was like kind of terrified

2508
02:52:54,370 --> 02:53:03,140
because his i don't know why but Lucas way of communicating is so different from what I was used to

2509
02:53:03,140 --> 02:53:10,540
that something about the way that when we called he spoke I was like the hell is wrong with this guy

2510
02:53:10,540 --> 02:53:17,540
like i was really just i was really just confused I was like what's what the hell is going on

2511
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:30,430
but then when we actually got around to streaming and he started showing that sense of humor to everybody I was like ah

2512
02:53:30,430 --> 02:53:40,050
i like I started really getting it and now that I see who Luca is and who he is to everybody like I really really get it

2513
02:53:40,050 --> 02:53:48,790
and honestly like at first i was like I've never I think the fact is I'd never spoken to someone with his sense of humor before

2514
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:53,570
and now that I see how he acts on stream and how he's been acting since we've gotten to know each other better

2515
02:53:53,570 --> 02:53:56,900
he is one of the funniest people I know

2516
02:53:56,900 --> 02:54:00,400
like he comes up with such amazing in-jokes

2517
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:05,900
he's so quick to come up with with with all of this shit

2518
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:11,190
and like I i really really think that Luca is such like a comedy genius

2519
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:15,040
and hanging out with him makes me feel

2520
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:16,620
i don't know I don't know

2521
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:19,740
i think I think that his sense of humor is such a unique thing

2522
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:23,330
and at first i was scared of it because I didn't i didn't get it

2523
02:54:23,330 --> 02:54:26,800
i was like what the fuck is this guy trying to say

2524
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:31,160
but like now that I've actually properly seen it I'm like okay okay

2525
02:54:31,950 --> 02:54:35,410
this guy knows what he's doing and he absolutely is like

2526
02:54:35,410 --> 02:54:40,300
he's in luxian because he knows what the fuck he's doing and I was like shit

2527
02:54:41,530 --> 02:54:43,950
i absolutely I don't even know how I act

2528
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:47,580
i I i absolutely gotta like being quick with the comedy

2529
02:54:47,580 --> 02:54:51,230
because like do I need to remind you of the lookie incident

2530
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:55,780
lookie less

2531
02:54:55,780 --> 02:55:01,880
yeah sorry I I've grown I've grown immune to it but like the way

2532
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:09,570
the way Luca said it when it happened how casually like it was such a drive-by statement from him

2533
02:55:09,570 --> 02:55:14,670
and I wasn't prepared for it at all and it just took me out

2534
02:55:17,270 --> 02:55:19,060
well thank you fox

2535
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:20,620
that's okay buddy

2536
02:55:20,620 --> 02:55:22,510
thank you

2537
02:55:22,510 --> 02:55:24,190
it's very sweet of you

2538
02:55:26,930 --> 02:55:36,060
i think my first impression is kind of more of like a like a what like uh what do you call it

2539
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:39,500
it was kind of like I just I just ordered some food I'm gonna be right back

2540
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,220
oh okay okay okay

2541
02:55:42,270 --> 02:55:46,430
yeah but okay what I what I thought it was kind of like an episodic memory right

2542
02:55:46,430 --> 02:55:53,780
so the first thing I thought of when i when uh when we were all just talking right

2543
02:55:53,780 --> 02:56:01,180
and we were like hey so well do I would you mind if I ask where y'all are from

2544
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:02,180
I think Vox asked that

2545
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:06,060
and then uh we we we are like oh I'm from here I'm from there

2546
02:56:06,060 --> 02:56:10,770
and then and then after i think I was the last one to answer that question

2547
02:56:10,770 --> 02:56:16,510
um but I think that was when I also heard Luca say oh I'm from australia

2548
02:56:16,510 --> 02:56:21,800
and I was like oh shoot he's australian

2549
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:24,380
oh shoot

2550
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:31,800
um

2551
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:39,120
but then also at the same time I was like wait am I the only an a guy in the whole group

2552
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:44,000
and then like that that worried me a little in like you know many ways

2553
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,470
but like but like also I was like

2554
02:56:47,470 --> 02:56:48,880
whoa

2555
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:50,180
kangaroos

2556
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:59,510
I'm sorry like every time every time like you know this isn't really a first impression

2557
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:03,430
but that's kind of like the things that I just think in my mind when those kind of things happen

2558
02:57:03,430 --> 02:57:05,870
so it kind of is a first impression but also not

2559
02:57:05,870 --> 02:57:11,300
um the first actual like impression of Luca as a person

2560
02:57:11,300 --> 02:57:15,190
not not his country

2561
02:57:15,190 --> 02:57:20,260
um is uh probably when uh we were in call that one time um

2562
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:27,180
and then we started sharing like tick tocks with each other

2563
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:28,460
yeah yeah

2564
02:57:28,460 --> 02:57:35,110
every tick tock Lucas ends contains at least like

2565
02:57:38,460 --> 02:57:45,860
like I'm trying to like wha what is that genre of tick tock

2566
02:57:45,860 --> 02:57:54,790
it's like surreal kind of like it's like it's like those tick tocks where like you don't know what's going on at all

2567
02:57:54,790 --> 02:57:59,460
but like at the end they just have like a zoom in of their face

2568
02:57:59,460 --> 02:58:04,960
like like a zoom in of like a giraffe's butt and it's like the funniest thing ever

2569
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:11,910
but like the talk talk itself makes no sense but there's like some random funny image at the end

2570
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:14,690
or like some random edit that makes it really funny

2571
02:58:14,690 --> 02:58:22,080
you know that kind of energy and I was like oh shoot this is the kind of vibes we're heading towards icsc

2572
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:32,150
and then I think that's kind of like was uh what uh showcased like how eccentric is that the word

2573
02:58:32,150 --> 02:58:33,570
yeah because

2574
02:58:35,020 --> 02:58:41,120
yeah that's the that's the kind of kind of vibe that I i felt from from Luca

2575
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:53,010
and also the and then and then um while we were calling also Luca has a really loud mouse wheel for some reason

2576
02:58:53,010 --> 02:58:54,410
oh yeah

2577
02:58:56,030 --> 02:59:01,410
you'll hear that like listen to that and it used to be so much worse

2578
02:59:01,410 --> 02:59:09,580
look like he would he would scroll through that and he'd be like what what's going on what what what are you saying keeps on scrolling on it

2579
02:59:09,580 --> 02:59:14,120
and then I was like i don't know it's not really like a clueless thing

2580
02:59:14,120 --> 02:59:20,640
but like it kind of like carries on to like other things

2581
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:26,790
like um you know you know in the the friday the 13th collab

2582
02:59:26,790 --> 02:59:30,370
when when pomu and I was like looking at the sky

2583
02:59:31,230 --> 02:59:31,830
yeah

2584
02:59:32,420 --> 02:59:35,300
yeah we were like yo look at the nice guy look at the nice guy

2585
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:37,580
and then you start looking at the nice sky

2586
02:59:37,580 --> 02:59:42,220
but we were actually not looking at the nice guy and we're just looking at butts

2587
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:44,670
why oh the ass of the character

2588
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:46,680
yeah but

2589
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:48,580
that wasn't really my focus

2590
02:59:51,130 --> 02:59:53,860
yeah we were like whoa look at the nice guy whoa whoa

2591
02:59:53,860 --> 02:59:58,950
well would you look at the whoa whoa whoa look at whoa whoa oh my gosh

2592
02:59:58,950 --> 03:00:00,660
what are you looking at

2593
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:03,220
like what do you mean what do you mean

2594
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:07,480
we're just looking at a bus

2595
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:11,290
but I think like something similar is like just still present throughout the time

2596
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:16,380
but that was the first time I really saw those kind of moments from Luca yeah

2597
03:00:16,380 --> 03:00:22,570
do you guys remember that one time when we were like chilling in cold with Luca and then he just like shouting

2598
03:00:22,570 --> 03:00:27,470
and we were like like we went there when the full aussie came out

2599
03:00:27,470 --> 03:00:30,370
yeah yeah when the full aussie came out in his voice

2600
03:00:30,370 --> 03:00:33,350
and we thought he was just like doing an impression or something

2601
03:00:33,350 --> 03:00:35,800
and he was like oh no was my mic

2602
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:37,550
i know exactly what has happened

2603
03:00:37,550 --> 03:00:43,660
so uh we were we were thinking of um the lines for the uh the trailer remember that

2604
03:00:43,660 --> 03:00:45,540
oh right right

2605
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:48,500
i was I was playing new world at that time

2606
03:00:48,500 --> 03:00:54,760
and in new world you can actually uh like voice chat people

2607
03:00:54,760 --> 03:01:00,940
so this this uh this low-level dude had pvp on

2608
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:08,480
so I turned on voice chat and actually started speaking in a really super thick australian accent shouted

2609
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:12,700
i didn't know these guys could hear me

2610
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:13,890
yeah

2611
03:01:13,890 --> 03:01:16,120
before you push to talk on you said

2612
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:22,050
i thought I had push the talk on in slack but slack doesn't have push to talk

2613
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:23,740
yeah yeah

2614
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:27,950
and we were all like what what's that

2615
03:01:27,950 --> 03:01:30,430
i was like oh my god get the hell out of here

2616
03:01:30,430 --> 03:01:32,220
yeah it was like i don't know

2617
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:37,540
like taking the piss but no like he was actually just shouting at someone

2618
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:43,800
it was glorious that moment lives rent-free in my head

2619
03:01:53,640 --> 03:01:56,120
oh I mean I just talked about you being australia

2620
03:01:56,120 --> 03:01:57,670
but yeah

2621
03:02:01,110 --> 03:02:02,170
shoot

2622
03:02:03,050 --> 03:02:11,550
my first I think Shu took me the longest to like sort of nail down like what kind of like what kind of vibe you had

2623
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:20,980
i don't know like there if there's a specific reason for that or if I was just really dense which you know is very possible because I'm not very bright

2624
03:02:21,810 --> 03:02:26,770
honestly I just feel like it's it's pretty unclear honestly

2625
03:02:27,730 --> 03:02:30,870
like like you know luke is pretty clear-cut

2626
03:02:30,870 --> 03:02:33,140
and mystis is like oh yeah

2627
03:02:33,140 --> 03:02:39,620
once you get a grasp on it it's like pretty cut and dry and like it's all there in front of you

2628
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:46,960
like I had a hard time figuring figuring out like what kind of kind of energy you would exude

2629
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:49,380
it became like more and more clear as time went on

2630
03:02:49,380 --> 03:02:58,900
like when when I saw that you were like gathering evidence dot zip and just just that name reference sort of started giving me an idea

2631
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:04,200
and you were very open to using the saucy e mode so that was also a big clue

2632
03:03:04,850 --> 03:03:05,510
okay

2633
03:03:05,510 --> 03:03:09,160
and and then with your worksheet

2634
03:03:09,160 --> 03:03:14,360
with your lore video for debut I was like okay okay

2635
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:20,140
yeah but prior to that I i just everything was sort of a blank slate for me

2636
03:03:20,140 --> 03:03:23,960
I wasn't entirely sure and like this really mean part of my brain was just like

2637
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:28,320
hmm i wonder if he speaks that way to me because he doesn't like me

2638
03:03:28,320 --> 03:03:31,500
but like i know that wasn't that wasn't the case

2639
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:35,390
but I it was just like a really how did i speak how did I speak

2640
03:03:35,390 --> 03:03:40,070
was it like that you didn't speak any particular way i was just over analyzing it like an idiot

2641
03:03:40,070 --> 03:03:41,410
oh

2642
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:46,660
it's like before I had like under like understood you more as a person

2643
03:03:46,660 --> 03:03:52,700
I was just like reading way too deep into things and just coming to the worst possible conclusions like a dummy

2644
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:58,350
but once like or more I got got more of a grasp on it

2645
03:03:58,350 --> 03:04:02,590
i was like okay okay I i get that this is what this dude is about

2646
03:04:02,590 --> 03:04:06,410
and you're a riot to be around it's always a lot of fun to see

2647
03:04:06,410 --> 03:04:10,520
you're always so like organized and know like how to figure stuff out

2648
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:12,900
and like i don't know if you you guys are aware

2649
03:04:12,900 --> 03:04:20,250
but like shu is like the one that's like who has been pitching a lot of our like collab ideas and funny stuff

2650
03:04:20,250 --> 03:04:24,970
like that whole seriously watching the tubers by yourself thing was his idea like

2651
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:27,640
I think you also suggested prop night which again

2652
03:04:27,640 --> 03:04:36,000
I think is like one of the highlights of my my time here in lexium that collab just it was so much fun

2653
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,520
yeah

2654
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:38,880
i had lots of plenty

2655
03:04:44,380 --> 03:04:45,600
argue

2656
03:04:46,090 --> 03:04:52,100
i uh I actually agree with Ike if like i can pinpoint um you right away

2657
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:54,690
like how you your personality was um

2658
03:04:54,690 --> 03:05:04,000
and I think that's mainly because you do such a good job of like uh kind of adapting to whoever you're talking to

2659
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:11,930
so like um you around like me only me would be different to you me and Vox

2660
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:14,790
or you me and Luca would also be different or

2661
03:05:14,790 --> 03:05:20,080
yeah I think you're good at adapting to what whoever you're around you know

2662
03:05:20,930 --> 03:05:22,440
um

2663
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:27,530
and so like i also didn't ex I didn't expect you to be so organized

2664
03:05:28,230 --> 03:05:37,810
like you're i think when you organize something like a collab it's really like

2665
03:05:37,810 --> 03:05:45,120
it's really hard to get us all to say like exactly what we want or need or think about a collab right

2666
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:50,380
because we're all in different time areas or we all have something to do or busy with streams ourselves

2667
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:55,200
but somehow when you do it like it always leads to a good result

2668
03:05:55,660 --> 03:05:57,490
i don't know how you do it

2669
03:05:57,490 --> 03:06:03,940
you just you

2670
03:06:03,940 --> 03:06:05,080
and I don't know how

2671
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:06,630
so I'm very impressed by that

2672
03:06:07,510 --> 03:06:09,160
but yeah

2673
03:06:11,490 --> 03:06:14,050
when I first messaged you I was

2674
03:06:15,030 --> 03:06:20,110
i wasn't like i think I thought you were quite mysterious which is ironic considering

2675
03:06:20,110 --> 03:06:21,180
hey yo

2676
03:06:24,550 --> 03:06:31,130
the reason why I thought that you were quite mysterious is because we like immediately called like the guys we all called

2677
03:06:31,130 --> 03:06:34,550
but um you couldn't make it to the call the first time

2678
03:06:34,550 --> 03:06:39,820
so we got to know each other a little bit first and then we didn't get to know you just yet

2679
03:06:39,820 --> 03:06:44,800
so i was like

2680
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:47,850
they're so mysterious what could they be possibly doing

2681
03:06:47,850 --> 03:06:49,680
like yeah

2682
03:06:50,450 --> 03:06:51,420
cool

2683
03:06:51,900 --> 03:06:52,820
pretty cool man

2684
03:06:52,820 --> 03:06:55,460
oh oh thanks thanks man

2685
03:06:55,460 --> 03:06:58,210
that would be pretty cool though

2686
03:06:58,210 --> 03:07:00,510
it would be pretty cool though

2687
03:07:03,860 --> 03:07:04,950
this box here

2688
03:07:06,190 --> 03:07:14,500
i am here I've had my game down I've been eating chicken and it's been real good

2689
03:07:14,500 --> 03:07:15,410
um

2690
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:19,890
shu you scared me yes

2691
03:07:19,890 --> 03:07:21,730
because his wife

2692
03:07:21,730 --> 03:07:30,850
because we were having a call and slack it was me Ike Luca and mister

2693
03:07:30,850 --> 03:07:33,460
and we were just kind of hanging out we were shooting the what the fuck

2694
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:38,260
and then Lucas's guys all right I'm uh I'm gonna go to bed

2695
03:07:38,260 --> 03:07:40,440
and then he just went to bed

2696
03:07:40,440 --> 03:07:45,580
i shit you not 10 seconds after he left you joined I was like

2697
03:07:46,310 --> 03:07:47,620
oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

2698
03:07:47,620 --> 03:07:50,910
who is this guy

2699
03:07:57,060 --> 03:08:01,710
like you had not joined us yet and I was like man I wonder when she's gonna join

2700
03:08:01,710 --> 03:08:07,670
the instant Luca is gone it was like you just stole his life energy and just were like

2701
03:08:07,670 --> 03:08:09,570
finally a moment to communicate

2702
03:08:09,570 --> 03:08:12,420
and it was just had to be he's like

2703
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:15,090
to be honest it's like within 10 seconds

2704
03:08:15,090 --> 03:08:16,760
it literally was it literally was

2705
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:21,230
and then like not fitting with the narrative I'm trying to spin about shu

2706
03:08:21,230 --> 03:08:24,270
but then ten seconds after shu left the call later on

2707
03:08:24,270 --> 03:08:27,740
Luca joined again and I was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2708
03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:28,780
i remember

2709
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:31,810
let's tell you the truth true

2710
03:08:31,810 --> 03:08:35,620
it's like i think I agree with all the other guys is that it was hard to put a pen on you

2711
03:08:35,620 --> 03:08:41,880
but the main thing is that like especially from the way you communicate and from your debut as well

2712
03:08:41,880 --> 03:08:48,050
I was like this guy is a leader he's uh he's like diaz guy you know

2713
03:08:48,050 --> 03:08:51,360
shu thinks of the collabs he helps with technology

2714
03:08:51,360 --> 03:08:57,390
he's he's he does so much to help Luxiem run as smoothly as it does

2715
03:08:57,390 --> 03:09:03,690
and believe me Luxiem doesn't need to run smoothly to run in a way that's funny

2716
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:09,680
but if it needs to run smoothly shu is there and he's always coming up with all of these unique ideas

2717
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:15,680
he's always doing all of this unique stuff to try and figure out like what he needs to do to make things work

2718
03:09:15,680 --> 03:09:22,070
and i I i think he's frankly incredible and to be honest like the way he looks overall

2719
03:09:22,070 --> 03:09:26,090
I think I might overall be kind of down bad for him the most I have to say

2720
03:09:31,020 --> 03:09:35,510
i mean look at this man's arms look at his hair look at his eyes

2721
03:09:36,930 --> 03:09:40,590
oh yeah we all didn't realize how buff she was at first yeah

2722
03:09:40,590 --> 03:09:43,860
I i think I might was the first one to point it out

2723
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:50,400
like when I was when I saw the rest of you guys the first thing I said was what are those guns though

2724
03:09:54,850 --> 03:09:57,200
yeah I don't need sorcery with these

2725
03:10:03,230 --> 03:10:07,280
my first impression of Shu was actually is that

2726
03:10:07,280 --> 03:10:11,740
I i uh i thought she didn't like me

2727
03:10:16,440 --> 03:10:22,090
because I messed the Shu like oh it's finally nice to uh talk to you

2728
03:10:22,090 --> 03:10:27,220
and and like you didn't reply for two days I'm like oh god

2729
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:31,570
yeah I didn't understand the the slack dm feature at first

2730
03:10:34,980 --> 03:10:36,890
yeah i don't know

2731
03:10:36,890 --> 03:10:45,550
and then once he finally uh it replied like because I always dm people in all caps most of the time

2732
03:10:45,550 --> 03:10:46,560
yeah

2733
03:10:46,560 --> 03:10:49,250
I think that's the case for everyone here

2734
03:10:49,250 --> 03:10:53,420
when I first like started talking to them in dms it was all caps

2735
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:58,730
and like she replied with full caps also and I was like okay okay

2736
03:10:58,730 --> 03:11:00,670
come on like like

2737
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:06,110
okay he's uh oh he's he's good he's good so far he's good so far

2738
03:11:06,110 --> 03:11:08,000
and so far

2739
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:15,060
again like we didn't really get to talk to each other for like a while because i time zone differences

2740
03:11:16,610 --> 03:11:19,530
sometimes he would be asleep and I would be like awake

2741
03:11:20,490 --> 03:11:21,760
and all that

2742
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:26,510
yeah but no like honestly I think out of all of us

2743
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:32,510
like in terms of uh daily streaming like necessities

2744
03:11:32,510 --> 03:11:36,200
I think I think she's like one of the most uh reliable people

2745
03:11:36,200 --> 03:11:42,530
you can kind of have around and obviously like he he helps out with a lot of tech stuff

2746
03:11:42,530 --> 03:11:44,830
and which is very very kind of them

2747
03:11:44,830 --> 03:11:48,280
oh I almost forgot when I first heard your voice

2748
03:11:49,260 --> 03:11:53,940
like uh-huh i was like oh his voice is very anime

2749
03:11:53,940 --> 03:11:56,160
it's very anime

2750
03:11:56,160 --> 03:12:08,140
it was very cool like very cool oh this guy's a really like nice sounding like the way he pronounces words was it was really nice

2751
03:12:08,140 --> 03:12:09,200
oh

2752
03:12:09,200 --> 03:12:11,010
yeah like that's what I thought

2753
03:12:11,860 --> 03:12:12,910
oh thanks

2754
03:12:12,910 --> 03:12:15,240

2755
03:12:17,790 --> 03:12:23,580

2756
03:12:26,370 --> 03:12:27,400

2757
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:32,740

2758
03:12:33,910 --> 03:12:36,300

03:12:36,860 --> 03:12:38,080

2760
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:41,620
